<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.

<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you

<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
<br /> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
<br /> the version number 2.1.]
<br />
<br />			    Preamble
<br />
<br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br />
<br />  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br />specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br />Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br />can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br />this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br />strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<br />
<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br />not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br />you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br />for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br />it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br />it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br />these things.
<br />
<br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br />rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br />you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br />you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br />code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br />complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br />with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br />it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br />library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br />
<br />  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br />there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br />modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br />that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br />author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br />introduced by others.
<br />
<br />  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br />any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br />effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br />restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br />any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br />consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br />
<br />  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br />General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br />is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br />this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br />libraries into non-free programs.
<br />
<br />  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br />a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br />combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br />General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br />entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br />Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br />the library.
<br />
<br />  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br />does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br />Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br />of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br />are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br />libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br />special circumstances.
<br />
<br />  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br />encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
<br />a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
<br />allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br />library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br />case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br />software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br />  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br />programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br />free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br />non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br />operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br />system.
<br />
<br />  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br />users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br />linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br />that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br />
<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br />"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br />former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br />be combined with the library in order to run.
<br /> 
<br />		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br />program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br />other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br />Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br />
<br />  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br />which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br />Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br />straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br />included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br />
<br />  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
<br />and installation of the library.
<br />
<br />  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br />writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br />  
<br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br />complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br />you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br />appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br />all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br />warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br />Library.
<br />
<br />  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br />fee.
<br /> 
<br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br />    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br />    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br />    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br />    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br />    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br />    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br />    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br />
<br />    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br />    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br />    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br />    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br />    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br />    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br />it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Library.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br />License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br />this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br />that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br />instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br />that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br />these notices.
<br /> 
<br />  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br />
<br />  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br />
<br />  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br />derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br />under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br />it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br />must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br />medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br />  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br />Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br />linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br />work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br />therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br />library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br />
<br />  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br />
<br />  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br />work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br />
<br />  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br /> 
<br />  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br />link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br />work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br />under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br />modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br />engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br />
<br />  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br />this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br />directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br />of these things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br />    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br />    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br />    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br />    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br />    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br />    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br />    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br />    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br />    to use the modified definitions.)
<br />
<br />    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br />    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br />    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br />    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br />    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br />    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
<br />    least three years, to give the same user the materials
<br />    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
<br />    than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br />
<br />    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br />    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br />    specified materials from the same place.
<br />
<br />    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br />    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br />
<br />  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br />Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br />reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br />the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br />the executable.
<br />
<br />  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br />accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br />distribute.
<br /> 
<br />  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br />facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br />library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br />the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br />permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br />    Sections above.
<br />
<br />    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br />    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br />    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br />  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br />the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br />attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br />distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br />rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br />or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br />terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Library or works based on it.
<br />
<br />  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br />subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br />this License.
<br /> 
<br />  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />impose that choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
<br />an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
<br />so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
<br />excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
<br />written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br />Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br />but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br />"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.
<br /> 
<br />  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br />write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br />copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br />Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br />decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br />of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br />and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />			    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br />KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br />LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br />THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br />FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br />CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br />LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br />RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
<br />SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br />DAMAGES.
<br />

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.

<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all

<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular

<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />

<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following

<br />----------
<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

<br />
<br />You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
<br />5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

<br />9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type

<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />

<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />

<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />

<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />

<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH

<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.

<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />               Version 2.1, February 1999
<br />
<br /> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
<br /> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
<br /> the version number 2.1.]
<br />
<br />                Preamble
<br />
<br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br />
<br />  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br />specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br />Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br />can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br />this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br />strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<br />
<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br />not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br />you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br />for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br />it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br />it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br />these things.
<br />
<br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br />rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br />you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br />you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br />code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br />complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br />with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br />it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br />library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br />
<br />  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br />there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br />modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br />that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br />author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br />introduced by others.
<br />
<br />  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br />any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br />effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br />restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br />any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br />consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br />
<br />  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br />General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br />is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br />this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br />libraries into non-free programs.
<br />
<br />  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br />a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br />combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br />General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br />entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br />Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br />the library.
<br />
<br />  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br />does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br />Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br />of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br />are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br />libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br />special circumstances.
<br />
<br />  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br />encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
<br />a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
<br />allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br />library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br />case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br />software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br />  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br />programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br />free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br />non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br />operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br />system.
<br />
<br />  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br />users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br />linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br />that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br />
<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br />"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br />former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br />be combined with the library in order to run.
<br />
<br />          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br />program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br />other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br />Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br />
<br />  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br />which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br />Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br />straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br />included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br />
<br />  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
<br />and installation of the library.
<br />
<br />  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br />writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br />  
<br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br />complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br />you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br />appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br />all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br />warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br />Library.
<br />
<br />  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br />fee.
<br />
<br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br />    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br />    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br />    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br />    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br />    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br />    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br />    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br />
<br />    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br />    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br />    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br />    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br />    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br />    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br />it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Library.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br />License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br />this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br />that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br />instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br />that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br />these notices.
<br />
<br />  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br />
<br />  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br />
<br />  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br />derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br />under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br />it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br />must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br />medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br />  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br />Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br />linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br />work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br />therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br />library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br />
<br />  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br />
<br />  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br />work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br />
<br />  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br />
<br />  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br />link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br />work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br />under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br />modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br />engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br />
<br />  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br />this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br />directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br />of these things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br />    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br />    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br />    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br />    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br />    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br />    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br />    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br />    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br />    to use the modified definitions.)
<br />
<br />    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br />    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br />    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br />    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br />    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br />    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
<br />    least three years, to give the same user the materials
<br />    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
<br />    than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br />
<br />    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br />    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br />    specified materials from the same place.
<br />
<br />    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br />    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br />
<br />  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br />Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br />reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br />the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br />the executable.
<br />
<br />  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br />accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br />distribute.
<br />
<br />  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br />facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br />library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br />the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br />permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br />    Sections above.
<br />
<br />    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br />    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br />    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br />  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br />the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br />attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br />distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br />rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br />or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br />terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Library or works based on it.
<br />
<br />  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br />subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br />this License.
<br />
<br />  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />impose that choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
<br />an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
<br />so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
<br />excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
<br />written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br />Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br />but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br />"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.
<br /> 
<br />  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br />write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br />copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br />Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br />decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br />of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br />and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />                NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br />KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br />LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br />THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br />FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br />CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br />LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br />RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
<br />SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br />DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br /> 
<br />           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br />
<br />  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
<br />everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
<br />redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
<br />ordinary General Public License).
<br />
<br />  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
<br />safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
<br />    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
<br />    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
<br />    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
<br />    Lesser General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
<br />necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
<br />

<br />That's all there is to it!

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular

<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />    Preamble
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />---
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />                            Preamble
<br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
<br />software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
<br />General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
<br />Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
<br />using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
<br />the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
<br />your programs, too.
<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<br />price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<br />have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<br />this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
<br />if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
<br />in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
<br />These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<br />gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
<br />you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
<br />source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
<br />rights.
<br />  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />authors' reputations.
<br />  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
<br />patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
<br />program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
<br />program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
<br />patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.
<br />                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
<br />a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
<br />under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
<br />refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
<br />means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
<br />that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
<br />either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
<br />language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
<br />the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
<br />is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
<br />Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
<br />Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
<br />source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
<br />conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
<br />copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
<br />notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
<br />and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
<br />along with the Program.
<br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
<br />    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
<br />    parties under the terms of this License.
<br />    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
<br />    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
<br />    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
<br />    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
<br />    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
<br />    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
<br />    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Program.
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />the scope of this License.
<br />  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
<br />    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
<br />    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />    customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
<br />    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
<br />    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
<br />    received the program in object code or executable form with such
<br />    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
<br />code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
<br />control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
<br />special exception, the source code distributed need not include
<br />anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
<br />form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
<br />operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
<br />itself accompanies the executable.
<br />If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
<br />access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
<br />access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
<br />distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
<br />otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
<br />void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
<br />However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
<br />this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
<br />parties remain in full compliance.
<br />  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Program or works based on it.
<br />  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
<br />this License.
<br />  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />circumstances.
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />impose that choice.
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
<br />may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
<br />those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
<br />countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
<br />the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
<br />of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<br />be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<br />address new problems or concerns.
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
<br />either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
<br />Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
<br />this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
<br />Foundation.
<br />  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
<br />to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
<br />Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
<br />make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
<br />of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
<br />of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />                            NO WARRANTY
<br />  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
<br />FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
<br />OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
<br />PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
<br />OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
<br />MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
<br />TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
<br />PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
<br />REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
<br />WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
<br />REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
<br />INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
<br />OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
<br />TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
<br />YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
<br />PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
<br />POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
<br />to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
<br />the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
<br />    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of="" author="">
<br />    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />    (at your option) any later version.
<br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
<br />    GNU General Public License for more details.
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
<br />    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
<br />    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<br />    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
<br />parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
<br />be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
<br />mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
<br />  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

<br />This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
<br />proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
<br />consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
<br />library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
<br />Public License instead of this License.

<br /> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />                            Preamble
<br />  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<br />software and other kinds of works.
<br />  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<br />to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<br />the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<br />share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<br />software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<br />GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<br />any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<br />your programs, too.
<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<br />price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<br />have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<br />them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<br />  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<br />these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<br />certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<br />you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<br />gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<br />freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<br />or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<br />know their rights.
<br />  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<br />(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<br />giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<br />  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
<br />that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
<br />authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<br />changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<br />authors of previous versions.
<br />  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<br />modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<br />can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<br />protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<br />pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<br />use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<br />have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<br />products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<br />stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<br />of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<br />  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<br />software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<br />avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<br />make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<br />patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.
<br />                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />  0. Definitions.
<br />  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<br />  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<br />works, such as semiconductor masks.
<br />  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<br />License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
<br />"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
<br />  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<br />in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<br />exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
<br />earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
<br />  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
<br />on the Program.
<br />  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
<br />permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<br />infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<br />computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<br />distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<br />public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<br />  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<br />parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<br />a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<br />  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
<br />to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
<br />feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<br />tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<br />extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<br />work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<br />the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<br />menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<br />  1. Source Code.
<br />  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
<br />for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
<br />form of a work.
<br />  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
<br />standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
<br />interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<br />is widely used among developers working in that language.
<br />  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
<br />than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
<br />packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<br />Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
<br />Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
<br />implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<br />"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
<br />(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<br />(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<br />produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<br />  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
<br />the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<br />work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
<br />control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
<br />System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
<br />programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
<br />which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
<br />includes interface definition files associated with source files for
<br />the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<br />linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
<br />such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
<br />subprograms and other parts of the work.
<br />  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
<br />can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
<br />Source.
<br />  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
<br />same work.
<br />  2. Basic Permissions.
<br />  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
<br />copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
<br />conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
<br />permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
<br />covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
<br />content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
<br />rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<br />  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
<br />convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
<br />in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
<br />of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
<br />with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
<br />the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
<br />not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
<br />for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
<br />and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
<br />your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<br />  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
<br />the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
<br />makes it unnecessary.
<br />  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<br />  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
<br />measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
<br />11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
<br />similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
<br />measures.
<br />  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
<br />circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
<br />is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
<br />the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
<br />modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
<br />users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
<br />technological measures.
<br />  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<br />  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
<br />receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br />appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
<br />keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
<br />non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
<br />keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
<br />recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
<br />and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<br />  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<br />  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
<br />produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
<br />terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
<br />    it, and giving a relevant date.
<br />    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
<br />    released under this License and any conditions added under section
<br />    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
<br />    "keep intact all notices".
<br />    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
<br />    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
<br />    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
<br />    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
<br />    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
<br />    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
<br />    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<br />    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
<br />    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
<br />    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
<br />    work need not make them do so.
<br />  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
<br />works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
<br />and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
<br />in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
<br />"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
<br />used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
<br />beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
<br />in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
<br />parts of the aggregate.
<br />  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<br />  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
<br />of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
<br />machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
<br />in one of these ways:
<br />    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
<br />    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
<br />    customarily used for software interchange.
<br />    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
<br />    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
<br />    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
<br />    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
<br />    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
<br />    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
<br />    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
<br />    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
<br />    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
<br />    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<br />    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
<br />    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
<br />    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
<br />    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
<br />    with subsection 6b.
<br />    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
<br />    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
<br />    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
<br />    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
<br />    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
<br />    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
<br />    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
<br />    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
<br />    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
<br />    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
<br />    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
<br />    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<br />    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
<br />    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
<br />    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
<br />    charge under subsection 6d.
<br />  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
<br />from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
<br />included in conveying the object code work.
<br />  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
<br />tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
<br />or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
<br />into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
<br />doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
<br />product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
<br />typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
<br />of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
<br />actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
<br />is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
<br />commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
<br />the only significant mode of use of the product.
<br />  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
<br />procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
<br />and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
<br />a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
<br />suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
<br />code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
<br />modification has been made.
<br />  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
<br />specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
<br />part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
<br />User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
<br />fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
<br />Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
<br />by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
<br />if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
<br />modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
<br />been installed in ROM).
<br />  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
<br />requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
<br />for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
<br />the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
<br />network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
<br />adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
<br />protocols for communication across the network.
<br />  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
<br />in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
<br />documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
<br />source code form), and must require no special password or key for
<br />unpacking, reading or copying.
<br />  7. Additional Terms.
<br />  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
<br />License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
<br />Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
<br />be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
<br />that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
<br />apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
<br />under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
<br />this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<br />  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
<br />remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
<br />it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
<br />removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
<br />additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
<br />for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<br />  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
<br />add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
<br />that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<br />    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
<br />    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<br />    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
<br />    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
<br />    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<br />    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
<br />    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
<br />    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<br />    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
<br />    authors of the material; or
<br />    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
<br />    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<br />    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
<br />    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
<br />    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
<br />    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
<br />    those licensors and authors.
<br />  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
<br />restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
<br />received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
<br />governed by this License along with a term that is a further
<br />restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
<br />a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
<br />License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
<br />of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
<br />not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<br />  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
<br />must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
<br />additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
<br />where to find the applicable terms.
<br />  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
<br />form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
<br />the above requirements apply either way.
<br />  8. Termination.
<br />  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
<br />provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
<br />modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
<br />this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
<br />paragraph of section 11).
<br />  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
<br />license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
<br />provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
<br />finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
<br />holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
<br />prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<br />  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
<br />reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
<br />violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
<br />received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
<br />copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
<br />your receipt of the notice.
<br />  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
<br />licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
<br />this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
<br />reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
<br />material under section 10.
<br />  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<br />  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
<br />run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
<br />occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
<br />to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
<br />nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
<br />modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
<br />not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
<br />covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<br />  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<br />  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
<br />receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
<br />propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
<br />for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<br />  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
<br />organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
<br />organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
<br />work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
<br />transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
<br />licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
<br />give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
<br />Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
<br />the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<br />  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
<br />rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
<br />not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
<br />rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
<br />(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
<br />any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
<br />sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<br />  11. Patents.
<br />  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
<br />License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
<br />work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
<br />  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
<br />owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
<br />hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
<br />by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
<br />but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
<br />consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
<br />purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
<br />patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
<br />this License.
<br />  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
<br />patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
<br />make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
<br />propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<br />  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
<br />agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
<br />(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
<br />sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
<br />party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
<br />patent against the party.
<br />  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
<br />and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
<br />to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
<br />publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
<br />then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
<br />available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
<br />patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
<br />consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
<br />license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
<br />actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
<br />covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
<br />in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
<br />country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<br />  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
<br />arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
<br />covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
<br />receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
<br />or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
<br />you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
<br />work and works based on it.
<br />  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
<br />the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
<br />conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
<br />specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
<br />work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
<br />in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
<br />to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
<br />the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
<br />parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
<br />patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
<br />conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
<br />for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
<br />contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
<br />or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<br />  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
<br />any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
<br />otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<br />  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<br />  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
<br />covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
<br />not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
<br />to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
<br />the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
<br />License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<br />  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<br />  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
<br />permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
<br />under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
<br />combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
<br />License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
<br />but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
<br />section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
<br />combination as such.
<br />  14. Revised Versions of this License.
<br />  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
<br />the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<br />be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<br />address new problems or concerns.
<br />  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
<br />Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
<br />Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
<br />option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
<br />version or of any later version published by the Free Software
<br />Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
<br />GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
<br />by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
<br />versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
<br />public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
<br />to choose that version for the Program.
<br />  Later license versions may give you additional or different
<br />permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
<br />author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
<br />later version.
<br />  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<br />  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
<br />APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
<br />HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
<br />OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
<br />THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
<br />IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
<br />ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />  16. Limitation of Liability.
<br />  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
<br />WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
<br />THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br />GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
<br />USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
<br />DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
<br />PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
<br />EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
<br />SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<br />  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
<br />above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
<br />reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
<br />an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
<br />Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
<br />copy of the Program in return for a fee.
<br />                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
<br />to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
<br />the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
<br />    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of="" author="">
<br />    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
<br />    (at your option) any later version.
<br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
<br />    GNU General Public License for more details.
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
<br />notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of="" author="">
<br />    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
<br />    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<br />    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
<br />parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
<br />might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
<br />  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
<br />if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
<br />For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<br />&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
<br />  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
<br />the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
<br />Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<br />&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.
<br />---------------------
<br />There are two licenses affecting GNU libstdc++: one for the code, and one for the documentation.
<br />There is a license section in the FAQ regarding common questions. If you have 
<br />more questions, ask the FSF or the gcc mailing list.
<br />The Code: GPL
<br />The source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3, 
<br />with the addition under section 7 of an exception described in the 
<br />"GCC Runtime Library Exception, version 3.1" as follows (or see the file COPYING.RUNTIME):
<br />GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
<br />Version 3.1, 31 March 2009
<br />Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
<br />license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
<br />permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
<br />3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
<br />bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
<br />the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
<br />When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
<br />certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
<br />program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
<br />non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
<br />header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
<br />0. Definitions.
<br />A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
<br />Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
<br />interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
<br />on the Runtime Library.
<br />"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
<br />modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
<br />the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
<br />subsequent versions published by the FSF.
<br />"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
<br />modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
<br />the license of GCC.
<br />"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
<br />target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
<br />input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
<br />phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
<br />format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
<br />for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
<br />The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
<br />non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
<br />Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
<br />use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
<br />part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
<br />understood as starting with the output of the generators or
<br />preprocessors.
<br />A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
<br />with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
<br />work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
<br />optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
<br />Eligible Compilation Process.
<br />1. Grant of Additional Permission.
<br />You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
<br />combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
<br />propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
<br />all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
<br />may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
<br />consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
<br />2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
<br />The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
<br />presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
<br />requirements of the license of GCC.
<br />    
<br />Hopefully that text is self-explanatory. If it isn't, you need to speak to your 
<br />lawyer, or the Free Software Foundation.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

<br />LICENSES
<br />----------
<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />

<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.

<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />

<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.

<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<br />EPL-2.0: LICENSE
<br />----------
<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
<br />
<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
<br />document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />Preamble
<br />
<br />The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
<br />and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
<br />guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
<br />software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
<br />most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
<br />authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
<br />covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
<br />your programs, too.
<br />
<br />When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
<br />General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
<br />distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
<br />that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
<br />the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
<br />can do these things.
<br />
<br />To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
<br />you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
<br />translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
<br />software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
<br />a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
<br />make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
<br />show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
<br />offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
<br />and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
<br />everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
<br />software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
<br />know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
<br />by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
<br />wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
<br />To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
<br />everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
<br />follow.
<br />
<br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
<br />placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
<br />or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
<br />derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
<br />Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
<br />translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
<br />without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
<br />"you".
<br />
<br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
<br />this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
<br />not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
<br />constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
<br />running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
<br />you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br />appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
<br />disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
<br />and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
<br />Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
<br />at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
<br />forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
<br />or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
<br />these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
<br />    that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
<br />    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
<br />    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
<br />    this License.
<br />
<br />    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
<br />    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
<br />    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
<br />    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
<br />    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
<br />    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
<br />    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
<br />    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
<br />    not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
<br />sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
<br />considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
<br />its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
<br />works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
<br />work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
<br />of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
<br />rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
<br />right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
<br />the Program.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
<br />Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
<br />distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
<br />License.
<br />
<br />3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
<br />Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
<br />2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
<br />    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
<br />    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
<br />    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
<br />    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
<br />    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
<br />    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
<br />    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
<br />    Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
<br />modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
<br />the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
<br />definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
<br />of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
<br />distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
<br />source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
<br />of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
<br />itself accompanies the executable.
<br />
<br />If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
<br />code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
<br />third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
<br />expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
<br />sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
<br />your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
<br />rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
<br />long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
<br />However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
<br />or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
<br />accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
<br />any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
<br />do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
<br />the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
<br />copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
<br />You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
<br />rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
<br />third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
<br />are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
<br />contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
<br />conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
<br />simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
<br />obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
<br />For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
<br />of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
<br />you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
<br />the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
<br />other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
<br />section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
<br />distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
<br />people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
<br />distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
<br />distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
<br />choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
<br />consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
<br />countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
<br />copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
<br />geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
<br />distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
<br />such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
<br />of this License.
<br />
<br />9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
<br />General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
<br />spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
<br />or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
<br />version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
<br />that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
<br />choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
<br />whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
<br />permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
<br />write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
<br />Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
<br />all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
<br />software generally.
<br />
<br />NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
<br />THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
<br />STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
<br />PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
<br />INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
<br />FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
<br />PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
<br />YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
<br />ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
<br />PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br />GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
<br />INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
<br />BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
<br />OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
<br />use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
<br />which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
<br />them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
<br />of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
<br />pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
<br />    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
<br />    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
<br />    any later version.
<br />
<br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
<br />    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
<br />    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
<br />    more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
<br />    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
<br />    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
<br />starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
<br />    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
<br />    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
<br />    type 'show c' for details.
<br />
<br />The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
<br />parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
<br />called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
<br />mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
<br />if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
<br />is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
<br />    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
<br />

<br />
<br />This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
<br />proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
<br />consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
<br />library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
<br />License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />
<br />"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
<br />
<br />Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are
<br />subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
<br />only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header
<br />the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
<br />exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
<br />    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
<br />    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
<br />    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
<br />    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
<br />    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
<br />    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
<br />    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
<br />    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
<br />    so, delete this exception statement from your version.

<br />     made by that particular Contributor.
<br />
<br />     1.3. "Covered Code" means the Original Code or Modifications or the
<br />     combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case
<br />     including portions thereof.
<br />
<br />     1.4. "Electronic Distribution Mechanism" means a mechanism generally
<br />     accepted in the software development community for the electronic
<br />     transfer of data.
<br />
<br />     1.5. "Executable" means Covered Code in any form other than Source
<br />     Code.
<br />
<br />     1.6. "Initial Developer" means the individual or entity identified
<br />     as the Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit
<br />     A.
<br />
<br />     1.7. "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or
<br />     portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />     1.8. "License" means this document.
<br />
<br />     1.8.1. "Licensable" means having the right to grant, to the maximum
<br />     extent possible, whether at the time of the initial grant or
<br />     subsequently acquired, any and all of the rights conveyed herein.
<br />
<br />     1.9. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the
<br />     substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous
<br />     Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a
<br />     Modification is:
<br />          A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
<br />          containing Original Code or previous Modifications.
<br />
<br />          B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or
<br />          previous Modifications.
<br />
<br />     1.10. "Original Code" means Source Code of computer software code
<br />     which is described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A as

<br />     compilation and installation of an Executable, or source code
<br />     differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another
<br />     well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The
<br />     Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the
<br />     appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available
<br />     for no charge.
<br />
<br />     1.12. "You" (or "Your")  means an individual or a legal entity
<br />     exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this
<br />     License or a future version of this License issued under Section 6.1.
<br />     For legal entities, "You" includes any entity which controls, is
<br />     controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes of
<br />     this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect,
<br />     to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
<br />     contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent
<br />     (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such
<br />     entity.
<br />
<br />2. Source Code License.
<br />
<br />     2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
<br />     The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
<br />     non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
<br />     claims:
<br />          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
<br />          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
<br />          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
<br />          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
<br />          as part of a Larger Work; and
<br />
<br />          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
<br />          selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
<br />          sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
<br />          Original Code (or portions thereof).
<br />
<br />          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
<br />          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
<br />          Original Code under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
<br />          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
<br />          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
<br />          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
<br />          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
<br />
<br />     2.2. Contributor Grant.
<br />     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
<br />     hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
<br />
<br />          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
<br />          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
<br />          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
<br />          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
<br />          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
<br />          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
<br />
<br />          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
<br />          selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
<br />          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
<br />          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
<br />          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
<br />          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
<br />          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
<br />          Version (or portions of such combination).
<br />
<br />          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
<br />          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
<br />          the Covered Code.
<br />
<br />          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
<br />          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
<br />          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
<br />          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
<br />          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
<br />          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
<br />          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
<br />          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
<br />          that Contributor.
<br />
<br />3. Distribution Obligations.
<br />
<br />     3.1. Application of License.
<br />     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
<br />     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
<br />     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
<br />     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
<br />     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
<br />     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
<br />     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
<br />     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
<br />     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
<br />     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
<br />     Section 3.5.
<br />
<br />     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
<br />     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
<br />     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
<br />     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
<br />     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
<br />     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
<br />     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
<br />     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
<br />     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
<br />     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
<br />     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
<br />     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
<br />
<br />     3.3. Description of Modifications.
<br />     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
<br />     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
<br />     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
<br />     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
<br />     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
<br />     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
<br />     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
<br />     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
<br />
<br />     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
<br />          (a) Third Party Claims.
<br />          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
<br />          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
<br />          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
<br />          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
<br />          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
<br />          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
<br />          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
<br />          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
<br />          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
<br />          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
<br />          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
<br />          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
<br />          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
<br />
<br />          (b) Contributor APIs.
<br />          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
<br />          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
<br />          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
<br />          also include this information in the LEGAL file.
<br />
<br />               (c)    Representations.
<br />          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
<br />          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
<br />          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
<br />          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
<br />          this License.
<br />
<br />     3.5. Required Notices.
<br />     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
<br />     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
<br />     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
<br />     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
<br />     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
<br />     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
<br />     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
<br />     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
<br />     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
<br />     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
<br />     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
<br />     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
<br />     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
<br />     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
<br />     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
<br />     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
<br />     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
<br />     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
<br />
<br />     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
<br />     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
<br />     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
<br />     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
<br />     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
<br />     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
<br />     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
<br />     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
<br />     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
<br />     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
<br />     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
<br />     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
<br />     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
<br />     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
<br />     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
<br />     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
<br />     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
<br />     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
<br />     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
<br />     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
<br />     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
<br />     terms You offer.
<br />
<br />     3.7. Larger Works.
<br />     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
<br />     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
<br />     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
<br />     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
<br />
<br />4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
<br />
<br />     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
<br />     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
<br />     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
<br />     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
<br />     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
<br />     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
<br />     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
<br />     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
<br />     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
<br />     understand it.
<br />
<br />5. Application of this License.
<br />
<br />     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
<br />     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
<br />
<br />6. Versions of the License.
<br />
<br />     6.1. New Versions.
<br />     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
<br />     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
<br />     will be given a distinguishing version number.
<br />
<br />     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
<br />     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
<br />     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
<br />     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
<br />     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
<br />     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
<br />     Covered Code created under this License.
<br />
<br />     6.3. Derivative Works.
<br />     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
<br />     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
<br />     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
<br />     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
<br />     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
<br />     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
<br />     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
<br />     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
<br />     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
<br />     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
<br />     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
<br />     this License.)
<br />
<br />7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
<br />
<br />     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
<br />     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
<br />     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
<br />     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
<br />     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
<br />     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
<br />     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
<br />     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
<br />     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
<br />
<br />8. TERMINATION.
<br />
<br />     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
<br />     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
<br />     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
<br />     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
<br />     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
<br />     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
<br />     shall survive.
<br />
<br />     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
<br />     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
<br />     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
<br />     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
<br />
<br />     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
<br />     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
<br />     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
<br />     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
<br />     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
<br />     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
<br />     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
<br />     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
<br />     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
<br />     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
<br />     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
<br />     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
<br />     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
<br />     the 60 day notice period specified above.
<br />
<br />     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
<br />     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
<br />     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
<br />     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
<br />     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
<br />     Participant.
<br />
<br />     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
<br />     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
<br />     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
<br />     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
<br />     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
<br />     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
<br />     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
<br />     license.
<br />
<br />     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
<br />     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
<br />     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
<br />     prior to termination shall survive termination.
<br />
<br />9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
<br />
<br />     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
<br />     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
<br />     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
<br />     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
<br />     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
<br />     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
<br />     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
<br />     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
<br />     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
<br />     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
<br />     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
<br />     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
<br />     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
<br />     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<br />
<br />10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
<br />
<br />     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
<br />     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
<br />     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
<br />     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
<br />     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
<br />     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
<br />     rights set forth herein.
<br />
<br />11. MISCELLANEOUS.
<br />
<br />     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
<br />     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
<br />     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
<br />     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
<br />     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
<br />     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
<br />     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
<br />     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
<br />     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
<br />     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
<br />     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
<br />     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
<br />     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
<br />     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
<br />     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
<br />     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
<br />     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
<br />     License.
<br />
<br />12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
<br />
<br />     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
<br />     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
<br />     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
<br />     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
<br />     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
<br />     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
<br />
<br />13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
<br />
<br />     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
<br />     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
<br />     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
<br />     Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
<br />     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"

<br />The GNU General Public License (GPL)
<br />
<br />Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
<br />
<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
<br />document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />Preamble
<br />
<br />The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
<br />and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
<br />guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
<br />software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
<br />most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
<br />authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
<br />covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
<br />your programs, too.
<br />
<br />When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
<br />General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
<br />distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
<br />that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
<br />the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
<br />can do these things.
<br />
<br />To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
<br />you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
<br />translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
<br />software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
<br />a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
<br />make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
<br />show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
<br />offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
<br />and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
<br />everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
<br />software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
<br />know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
<br />by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
<br />wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
<br />To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
<br />everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
<br />follow.
<br />
<br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
<br />placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
<br />or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
<br />derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
<br />Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
<br />translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
<br />without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
<br />"you".
<br />
<br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
<br />this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
<br />not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
<br />constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
<br />running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
<br />you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br />appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
<br />disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
<br />and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
<br />Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
<br />at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
<br />forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
<br />or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
<br />these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
<br />    that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
<br />    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
<br />    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
<br />    this License.
<br />
<br />    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
<br />    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
<br />    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
<br />    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
<br />    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
<br />    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
<br />    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
<br />    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
<br />    not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
<br />sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
<br />considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
<br />its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
<br />works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
<br />work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
<br />of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
<br />rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
<br />right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
<br />the Program.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
<br />Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
<br />distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
<br />License.
<br />
<br />3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
<br />Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
<br />2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
<br />    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
<br />    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
<br />    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
<br />    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
<br />    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
<br />    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
<br />    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
<br />    Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
<br />modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
<br />the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
<br />definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
<br />of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
<br />distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
<br />source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
<br />of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
<br />itself accompanies the executable.
<br />
<br />If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
<br />code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
<br />third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
<br />expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
<br />sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
<br />your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
<br />rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
<br />long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
<br />However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
<br />or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
<br />accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
<br />any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
<br />do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
<br />the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
<br />copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
<br />You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
<br />rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
<br />third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
<br />are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
<br />contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
<br />conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
<br />simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
<br />obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
<br />For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
<br />of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
<br />you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
<br />the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
<br />other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
<br />section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
<br />distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
<br />people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
<br />distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
<br />distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
<br />choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
<br />consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
<br />countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
<br />copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
<br />geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
<br />distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
<br />such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
<br />of this License.
<br />
<br />9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
<br />General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
<br />spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
<br />or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
<br />version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
<br />that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
<br />choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
<br />whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
<br />permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
<br />write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
<br />Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
<br />all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
<br />software generally.
<br />
<br />NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
<br />THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
<br />STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
<br />PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
<br />INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
<br />FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
<br />PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
<br />YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
<br />ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
<br />PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br />GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
<br />INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
<br />BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
<br />OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
<br />use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
<br />which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
<br />them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
<br />of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
<br />pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
<br />    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
<br />    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
<br />    any later version.
<br />
<br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
<br />    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
<br />    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
<br />    more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
<br />    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
<br />    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
<br />starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
<br />    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
<br />    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
<br />    type 'show c' for details.
<br />
<br />The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
<br />parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
<br />called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
<br />mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
<br />if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
<br />is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
<br />    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

<br />
<br />This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
<br />proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
<br />consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
<br />library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
<br />License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />
<br />"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
<br />
<br />Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are
<br />subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
<br />only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header
<br />the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
<br />exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
<br />    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
<br />    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
<br />    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
<br />    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
<br />    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
<br />    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
<br />    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
<br />    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
<br />    so, delete this exception statement from your version.&lt;/td&gt;

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />

<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE

<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present

<br />Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes
<br />the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those

<br />Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be
<br />freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or
<br />otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
<br />and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor

<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />

<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />## Eclipse Public License - Version 2.0
<br />
<br />    Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor

<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br /> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br /> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
<br /> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
<br /> the version number 2.1.]
<br />
<br />                            Preamble
<br />
<br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br />
<br />  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br />specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br />Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br />can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br />this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br />strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<br />
<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br />not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br />you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br />for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br />it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br />it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br />these things.
<br />
<br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br />rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br />you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br />you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br />code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br />complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br />with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br />it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br />library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br />
<br />  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br />there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br />modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br />that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br />author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br />introduced by others.
<br />
<br />  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br />any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br />effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br />restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br />any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br />consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br />
<br />  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br />General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br />is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br />this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br />libraries into non-free programs.
<br />
<br />  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br />a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br />combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br />General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br />entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br />Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br />the library.
<br />
<br />  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br />does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br />Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br />of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br />are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br />libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br />special circumstances.
<br />
<br />  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br />encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
<br />a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
<br />allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br />library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br />case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br />software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br />  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br />programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br />free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br />non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br />operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br />system.
<br />
<br />  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br />users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br />linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br />that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br />
<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br />"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br />former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br />be combined with the library in order to run.
<br />
<br />                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br />program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br />other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br />Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br />
<br />  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br />which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br />Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br />straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br />included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br />
<br />  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
<br />and installation of the library.
<br />
<br />  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br />writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br />
<br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br />complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br />you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br />appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br />all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br />warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br />Library.
<br />
<br />  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br />fee.
<br />
<br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br />    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br />    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br />    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br />    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br />    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br />    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br />    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br />
<br />    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br />    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br />    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br />    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br />    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br />    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br />it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Library.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br />License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br />this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br />that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br />instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br />that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br />these notices.
<br />
<br />  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br />
<br />  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br />
<br />  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br />derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br />under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br />it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br />must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br />medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br />  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br />Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br />linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br />work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br />therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br />library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br />
<br />  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br />
<br />  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br />work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br />
<br />  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br />
<br />  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br />link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br />work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br />under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br />modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br />engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br />
<br />  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br />this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br />directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br />of these things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br />    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br />    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br />    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br />    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br />    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br />    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br />    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br />    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br />    to use the modified definitions.)
<br />
<br />    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br />    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br />    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br />    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br />    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br />    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
<br />    least three years, to give the same user the materials
<br />    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
<br />    than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br />
<br />    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br />    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br />    specified materials from the same place.
<br />
<br />    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br />    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br />
<br />  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br />Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br />reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br />the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br />the executable.
<br />
<br />  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br />accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br />distribute.
<br />
<br />  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br />facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br />library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br />the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br />permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br />    Sections above.
<br />
<br />    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br />    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br />    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br />  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br />the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br />attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br />distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br />rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br />or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br />terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Library or works based on it.
<br />
<br />  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br />subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br />this License.
<br />
<br />  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />impose that choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
<br />an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
<br />so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
<br />excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
<br />written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br />Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br />but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br />"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br />write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br />copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br />Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br />decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br />of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br />and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />                            NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br />KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br />LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br />THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br />FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br />CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br />LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br />RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
<br />SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br />DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br />
<br />  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
<br />everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
<br />redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
<br />ordinary General Public License).
<br />
<br />  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
<br />safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
<br />    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
<br />    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
<br />    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
<br />    Lesser General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
<br />necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular

<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this

<br />Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
<br />
<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
<br />document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />Preamble
<br />
<br />The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
<br />and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
<br />guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
<br />software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
<br />most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
<br />authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
<br />covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
<br />your programs, too.
<br />
<br />When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
<br />General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
<br />distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
<br />that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
<br />the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
<br />can do these things.
<br />
<br />To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
<br />you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
<br />translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
<br />software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
<br />a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
<br />make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
<br />show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
<br />offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
<br />and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
<br />everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
<br />software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
<br />know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
<br />by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
<br />wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
<br />To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
<br />everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
<br />follow.
<br />
<br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
<br />placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
<br />or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
<br />derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
<br />Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
<br />translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
<br />without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
<br />"you".
<br />
<br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
<br />this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
<br />not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
<br />constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
<br />running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
<br />you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br />appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
<br />disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
<br />and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
<br />Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
<br />at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
<br />forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
<br />or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
<br />these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
<br />    that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
<br />    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
<br />    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
<br />    this License.
<br />
<br />    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
<br />    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
<br />    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
<br />    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
<br />    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
<br />    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
<br />    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
<br />    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
<br />    not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
<br />sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
<br />considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
<br />its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
<br />works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
<br />work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
<br />of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
<br />rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
<br />right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
<br />the Program.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
<br />Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
<br />distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
<br />License.
<br />
<br />3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
<br />Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
<br />2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
<br />    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
<br />    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
<br />    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
<br />    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
<br />    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
<br />    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
<br />    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
<br />    Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
<br />modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
<br />the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
<br />definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
<br />of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
<br />distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
<br />source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
<br />of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
<br />itself accompanies the executable.
<br />
<br />If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
<br />code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
<br />third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
<br />expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
<br />sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
<br />your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
<br />rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
<br />long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
<br />However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
<br />or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
<br />accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
<br />any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
<br />do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
<br />the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
<br />copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
<br />You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
<br />rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
<br />third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
<br />are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
<br />contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
<br />conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
<br />simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
<br />obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
<br />For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
<br />of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
<br />you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
<br />the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
<br />other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
<br />section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
<br />distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
<br />people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
<br />distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
<br />distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
<br />choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
<br />consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
<br />countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
<br />copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
<br />geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
<br />distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
<br />such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
<br />of this License.
<br />
<br />9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
<br />General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
<br />spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
<br />or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
<br />version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
<br />that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
<br />choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
<br />whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
<br />permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
<br />write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
<br />Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
<br />all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
<br />software generally.
<br />
<br />NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
<br />THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
<br />STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
<br />PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
<br />INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
<br />FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
<br />PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
<br />YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
<br />ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
<br />PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br />GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
<br />INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
<br />BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
<br />OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
<br />use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
<br />which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
<br />them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
<br />of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
<br />pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
<br />    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
<br />    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
<br />    any later version.
<br />
<br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
<br />    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
<br />    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
<br />    more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
<br />    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
<br />    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
<br />starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
<br />    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
<br />    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
<br />    type 'show c' for details.
<br />
<br />The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
<br />parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
<br />called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
<br />mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
<br />if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
<br />is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
<br />    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

<br />This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
<br />proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
<br />consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
<br />library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
<br />License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />
<br />"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
<br />
<br />Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are
<br />subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
<br />only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header
<br />the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
<br />exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
<br />    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
<br />    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
<br />    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
<br />    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
<br />    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
<br />    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
<br />    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
<br />    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
<br />    so, delete this exception statement from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />## Eclipse Public License - Version 2.0
<br />
<br />    Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br /> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br /> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
<br /> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
<br /> the version number 2.1.]
<br />
<br />                            Preamble
<br />
<br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br />
<br />  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br />specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br />Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br />can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br />this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br />strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<br />
<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br />not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br />you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br />for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br />it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br />it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br />these things.
<br />
<br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br />rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br />you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br />you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br />code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br />complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br />with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br />it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br />library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br />
<br />  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br />there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br />modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br />that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br />author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br />introduced by others.
<br />
<br />  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br />any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br />effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br />restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br />any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br />consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br />
<br />  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br />General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br />is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br />this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br />libraries into non-free programs.
<br />
<br />  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br />a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br />combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br />General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br />entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br />Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br />the library.
<br />
<br />  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br />does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br />Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br />of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br />are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br />libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br />special circumstances.
<br />
<br />  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br />encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
<br />a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
<br />allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br />library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br />case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br />software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br />  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br />programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br />free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br />non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br />operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br />system.
<br />
<br />  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br />users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br />linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br />that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br />
<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br />"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br />former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br />be combined with the library in order to run.
<br />
<br />                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br />program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br />other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br />Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br />
<br />  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br />which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br />Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br />straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br />included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br />
<br />  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
<br />and installation of the library.
<br />
<br />  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br />writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br />
<br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br />complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br />you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br />appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br />all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br />warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br />Library.
<br />
<br />  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br />fee.
<br />
<br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br />    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br />    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br />    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br />    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br />    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br />    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br />    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br />
<br />    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br />    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br />    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br />    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br />    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br />    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br />it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Library.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br />License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br />this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br />that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br />instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br />that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br />these notices.
<br />
<br />  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br />
<br />  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br />
<br />  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br />derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br />under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br />it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br />must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br />medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br />  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br />Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br />linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br />work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br />therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br />library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br />
<br />  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br />
<br />  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br />work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br />
<br />  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br />
<br />  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br />link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br />work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br />under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br />modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br />engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br />
<br />  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br />this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br />directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br />of these things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br />    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br />    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br />    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br />    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br />    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br />    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br />    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br />    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br />    to use the modified definitions.)
<br />
<br />    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br />    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br />    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br />    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br />    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br />    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
<br />    least three years, to give the same user the materials
<br />    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
<br />    than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br />
<br />    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br />    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br />    specified materials from the same place.
<br />
<br />    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br />    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br />
<br />  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br />Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br />reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br />the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br />the executable.
<br />
<br />  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br />accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br />distribute.
<br />
<br />  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br />facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br />library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br />the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br />permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br />    Sections above.
<br />
<br />    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br />    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br />    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br />  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br />the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br />attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br />distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br />rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br />or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br />terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Library or works based on it.
<br />
<br />  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br />subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br />this License.
<br />
<br />  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />impose that choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
<br />an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
<br />so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
<br />excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
<br />written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br />Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br />but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br />"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br />write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br />copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br />Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br />decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br />of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br />and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />                            NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br />KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br />LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br />THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br />FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br />CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br />LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br />RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
<br />SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br />DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br />
<br />  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
<br />everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
<br />redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
<br />ordinary General Public License).
<br />
<br />  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
<br />safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
<br />    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
<br />    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
<br />    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
<br />    Lesser General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
<br />necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
<br />
<br />  <signature of="" Ty="" Coon="">, 1 April 1990
<br />  Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />That's all there is to it!

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br />===========================================
<br />
<br />EPL-1.0 AND LGPL-2.1 licenses:
<br />-------
<br />Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
<br />
<br />THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
<br />LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
<br />CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />"Contribution" means:
<br />     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
<br />     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
<br />          i) changes to the Program, and
<br />          ii) additions to the Program;
<br />
<br />where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
<br />distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
<br />Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or
<br />anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
<br />additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
<br />distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
<br />and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
<br />"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
<br />necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
<br />combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
<br />Agreement.
<br />
<br />"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
<br />including all Contributors.
<br />
<br />2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
<br />     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
<br />     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
<br />     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
<br />
<br />     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
<br />     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
<br />     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
<br />     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
<br />     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
<br />     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is
<br />     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
<br />     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
<br />     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
<br />     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent
<br />     or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
<br />     Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
<br />     any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
<br />     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
<br />     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
<br />     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
<br />     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute
<br />     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />     before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
<br />     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
<br />     license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
<br />its own license agreement, provided that:
<br />
<br />     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
<br />
<br />     b) its license agreement:
<br />          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
<br />          warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
<br />          or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
<br />          or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
<br />          purpose;
<br />          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
<br />          for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
<br />          consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
<br />          offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
<br />          iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
<br />          Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
<br />          manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
<br />          exchange.
<br />
<br />When the Program is made available in source code form:
<br />
<br />     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
<br />
<br />     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
<br />     Program.
<br />Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
<br />the Program.
<br />
<br />Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
<br />if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
<br />the originator of the Contribution.
<br />
<br />4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
<br />respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
<br />intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
<br />includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
<br />which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
<br />if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
<br />Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
<br />every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and
<br />other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
<br />Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
<br />product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
<br />or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
<br />infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
<br />promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
<br />allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
<br />Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
<br />Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
<br />offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
<br />that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
<br />warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
<br />such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
<br />Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
<br />Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
<br />court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
<br />Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
<br />
<br />5. NO WARRANTY
<br />EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
<br />"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
<br />NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
<br />Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
<br />and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
<br />exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the
<br />risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to
<br />or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
<br />operations.
<br />
<br />6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
<br />CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
<br />SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
<br />LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
<br />OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
<br />remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
<br />parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
<br />necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
<br />(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
<br />infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
<br />under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
<br />comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
<br />not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
<br />such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
<br />Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
<br />reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
<br />and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
<br />and survive.
<br />
<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
<br />order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
<br />modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
<br />publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
<br />time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
<br />Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
<br />Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
<br />Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
<br />be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
<br />Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
<br />Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
<br />Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
<br />(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
<br />stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
<br />licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
<br />whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
<br />Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
<br />
<br />This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
<br />intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
<br />Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
<br />after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
<br />in any resulting litigation.

<br />                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />                       Version 2.1, February 1999
<br />
<br /> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br /> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
<br /> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
<br /> the version number 2.1.]
<br />
<br />                            Preamble
<br />
<br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br />
<br />  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br />specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br />Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br />can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br />this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br />strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<br />
<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br />not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br />you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br />for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br />it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br />it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br />these things.
<br />
<br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br />rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br />you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br />you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br />code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br />complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br />with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br />it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br />library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br />
<br />  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br />there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br />modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br />that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br />author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br />introduced by others.
<br />
<br />  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br />any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br />effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br />restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br />any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br />consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br />
<br />  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br />General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br />is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br />this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br />libraries into non-free programs.
<br />
<br />  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br />a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br />combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br />General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br />entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br />Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br />the library.
<br />
<br />  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br />does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br />Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br />of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br />are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br />libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br />special circumstances.
<br />
<br />  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br />encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
<br />a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
<br />allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br />library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br />case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br />software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br />  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br />programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br />free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br />non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br />operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br />system.
<br />
<br />  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br />users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br />linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br />that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br />
<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br />"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br />former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br />be combined with the library in order to run.
<br />
<br />                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br />program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br />other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br />Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br />
<br />  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br />which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br />Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br />straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br />included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br />
<br />  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
<br />and installation of the library.
<br />
<br />  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br />writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br />
<br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br />complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br />you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br />appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br />all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br />warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br />Library.
<br />
<br />  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br />fee.
<br />
<br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br />    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br />    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br />    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br />    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br />    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br />    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br />    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br />
<br />    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br />    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br />    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br />    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br />    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br />    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br />it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Library.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br />License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br />this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br />that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br />instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br />that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br />these notices.
<br />
<br />  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br />
<br />  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br />
<br />  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br />derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br />under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br />it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br />must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br />medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br />  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br />Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br />linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br />work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br />therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br />library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br />
<br />  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br />
<br />  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br />work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br />
<br />  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br />
<br />  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br />link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br />work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br />under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br />modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br />engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br />
<br />  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br />this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br />directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br />of these things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br />    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br />    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br />    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br />    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br />    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br />    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br />    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br />    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br />    to use the modified definitions.)
<br />
<br />    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br />    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br />    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br />    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br />    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br />    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
<br />    least three years, to give the same user the materials
<br />    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
<br />    than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br />
<br />    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br />    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br />    specified materials from the same place.
<br />
<br />    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br />    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br />
<br />  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br />Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br />reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br />the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br />the executable.
<br />
<br />  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br />accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br />distribute.
<br />
<br />  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br />facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br />library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br />the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br />permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br />    Sections above.
<br />
<br />    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br />    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br />    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br />  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br />the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br />attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br />distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br />rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br />or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br />terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Library or works based on it.
<br />
<br />  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br />subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br />this License.
<br />
<br />  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />impose that choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
<br />an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
<br />so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
<br />excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
<br />written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br />Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br />but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br />"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br />write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br />copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br />Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br />decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br />of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br />and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />                            NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br />KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br />LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br />THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br />FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br />CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br />LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br />RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
<br />SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br />DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br />
<br />  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
<br />everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
<br />redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
<br />ordinary General Public License).
<br />
<br />  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
<br />safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
<br />    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
<br />    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
<br />    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
<br />    Lesser General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
<br />necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

<br />Oracle Free Use Terms and Conditions license
<br />
<br />Definitions
<br />
<br />"Oracle" refers to Oracle America, Inc. "You" and "Your" refers to 
<br />(a) a company or organization (each an "Entity") accessing the Programs, if use 
<br />of the Programs will be on behalf of such Entity; or 
<br />(b) an individual accessing the Programs, if use of the Programs will not be on 
<br />behalf of an Entity. "Program(s)" refers to Oracle software provided by Oracle 
<br />pursuant to the following terms and any updates, error corrections, and/or 
<br />Program Documentation provided by Oracle. "Program Documentation" refers to 
<br />Program user manuals and Program installation manuals, if any. If available, 
<br />Program Documentation may be delivered with the Programs and/or may be accessed 
<br />from www.oracle.com/documentation. "Separate Terms" refers to separate license 
<br />terms that are specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice files 
<br />and that apply to Separately Licensed Technology. "Separately Licensed Technology" 
<br />refers to Oracle or third party technology that is licensed under Separate Terms 
<br />and not under the terms of this license.
<br />
<br />Separately Licensed Technology
<br />
<br />Oracle may provide certain notices to You in Program Documentation, readmes or 
<br />notice files in connection with Oracle or third party technology provided as or 
<br />with the Programs. If specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice 
<br />files, such technology will be licensed to You under Separate Terms. Your rights 
<br />to use Separately Licensed Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted in 
<br />any way by the terms herein. For clarity, notwithstanding the existence of a 
<br />notice, third party technology that is not Separately Licensed Technology shall 
<br />be deemed part of the Programs licensed to You under the terms of this license.
<br />
<br />Source Code for Open Source Software
<br />
<br />For software that You receive from Oracle in binary form that is licensed under 
<br />an open source license that gives You the right to receive the source code for 
<br />that binary, You can obtain a copy of the applicable source code from 
<br />https://oss.oracle.com/sources/ or http://www.oracle.com/goto/opensourcecode. 
<br />If the source code for such software was not provided to You with the binary, 
<br />You can also receive a copy of the source code on physical media by submitting 
<br />a written request pursuant to the instructions in the "Written Offer for Source 
<br />Code" section of the latter website.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The following license terms apply to those Programs that are not provided to You 
<br />under Separate Terms.
<br />
<br />License Rights and Restrictions
<br />
<br />Oracle grants to You, as a recipient of this Program, a nonexclusive, 
<br />nontransferable, limited license to, subject to the conditions stated herein, 
<br />(a) internally use the unmodified Programs for the purposes of developing, 
<br />testing, prototyping and demonstrating your applications, and running the 
<br />Programs for your own internal business operations; and 
<br />(b) redistribute unmodified Programs and Programs Documentation, under the terms 
<br />of this License, provided that You do not charge Your end users any additional 
<br />fees for the use of the Programs. You may make copies of the Programs to the 
<br />extent reasonably necessary for exercising the license rights granted herein 
<br />and for backup purposes. You are granted the right to use the Programs to 
<br />provide third party training in the use of the Programs and associated Separately 
<br />Licensed Technology only if there is express authorization of such use by Oracle 
<br />on the Program's download page or in the Program Documentation.
<br />
<br />Your license is contingent on Your compliance with the following conditions:
<br />
<br />- You include a copy of this license with any distribution by You of the Programs;
<br />
<br />- You do not remove markings or notices of either Oracle's or a licensor's 
<br />proprietary rights from the Programs or Program Documentation;
<br />
<br />- You comply with all U.S. and applicable export control and economic sanctions 
<br />laws and regulations that govern Your use of the Programs (including technical data);
<br />
<br />- You do not cause or permit reverse engineering, disassembly or decompilation 
<br />of the Programs (except as allowed by law) by You nor allow an associated party to do so.
<br />
<br />For clarity, any source code that may be included in the distribution with the 
<br />Programs is provided solely for reference purposes and may not be modified, 
<br />unless such source code is under Separate Terms permitting modification.
<br />
<br />Ownership
<br />
<br />Oracle or its licensors retain all ownership and intellectual property rights to the Programs.
<br />
<br />Information Collection
<br />
<br />The Programs' installation and/or auto-update processes, if any, may transmit a 
<br />limited amount of data to Oracle or its service provider about those processes 
<br />to help Oracle understand and optimize them. Oracle does not associate the data 
<br />with personally identifiable information. 
<br />Refer to Oracle's Privacy Policy at www.oracle.com/privacy.
<br />
<br />Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability
<br />
<br />THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ORACLE FURTHER 
<br />DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.
<br />
<br />IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL ORACLE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR 
<br />DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
<br />ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
<br />TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
<br />THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), 
<br />EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.
