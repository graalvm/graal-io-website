<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">

<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:

<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by

<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />

<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject
<br />    to third party intellectual property claims, the Initial Developer
<br />    hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
<br />
<br />    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
<br />    trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use, reproduce,
<br />    modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
<br />    Software (or portions thereof), with or without Modifications,
<br />    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
<br />
<br />    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
<br />    Original Software, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and
<br />    offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software
<br />    (or portions thereof).
<br />
<br />    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on
<br />    the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes the
<br />    Original Software available to a third party under the terms of this
<br />    License.
<br />
<br />    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
<br />    granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software, or
<br />    (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the
<br />    Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software
<br />    with other software or devices.
<br />
<br />    2.2. Contributor Grant.
<br />
<br />    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject
<br />    to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby
<br />    grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
<br />
<br />    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
<br />    trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify,
<br />    display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
<br />    created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an
<br />    unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software
<br />    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
<br />
<br />    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
<br />    of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
<br />    combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
<br />    combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
<br />    otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or
<br />    portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by
<br />    that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
<br />    combination).
<br />
<br />    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective
<br />    on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the
<br />    Modifications available to a third party.
<br />
<br />    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
<br />    granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
<br />    Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third
<br />    party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination
<br />    of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software
<br />    (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)
<br />    under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
<br />    Modifications made by that Contributor.
<br />
<br />3. Distribution Obligations.
<br />
<br />    3.1. Availability of Source Code.
<br />
<br />    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
<br />    in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
<br />    and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
<br />    of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
<br />    copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
<br />    or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
<br />    Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
<br />    Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
<br />    through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
<br />
<br />    3.2. Modifications.
<br />
<br />    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
<br />    governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
<br />    believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
<br />    have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
<br />
<br />    3.3. Required Notices.
<br />
<br />    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
<br />    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
<br />    remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
<br />    within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
<br />    descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
<br />    Initial Developer.
<br />
<br />    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
<br />
<br />    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
<br />    Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
<br />    this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
<br />    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
<br />    liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
<br />    However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
<br />    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
<br />    absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
<br />    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
<br />    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
<br />    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
<br />    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
<br />
<br />    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
<br />
<br />    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
<br />    the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
<br />    choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
<br />    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
<br />    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
<br />    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
<br />    the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
<br />    Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
<br />    it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
<br />    are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
<br />    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
<br />    every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
<br />    Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
<br />
<br />    3.6. Larger Works.
<br />
<br />    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
<br />    other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
<br />    the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
<br />    sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
<br />    Software.
<br />
<br />4. Versions of the License.
<br />
<br />    4.1. New Versions.
<br />
<br />    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
<br />    new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
<br />    given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
<br />    4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
<br />    this License.
<br />
<br />    4.2. Effect of New Versions.
<br />
<br />    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
<br />    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
<br />    License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
<br />    the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
<br />    prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
<br />    under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
<br />    make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
<br />    of the License under which You originally received the Covered
<br />    Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
<br />    otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
<br />    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
<br />
<br />    4.3. Modified Versions.
<br />
<br />    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
<br />    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
<br />    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
<br />    remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
<br />    note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
<br />    make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
<br />    License.
<br />
<br />5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
<br />
<br />    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
<br />    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
<br />    IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
<br />    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
<br />    THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
<br />    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
<br />    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
<br />    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
<br />    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
<br />    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
<br />
<br />6. TERMINATION.
<br />
<br />    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
<br />    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
<br />    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
<br />    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
<br />    termination of this License shall survive.
<br />
<br />    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
<br />    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
<br />    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
<br />    assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
<br />    Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
<br />    Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
<br />    Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
<br />    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
<br />    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
<br />    Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
<br />    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
<br />    from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
<br />    expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
<br />    day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
<br />    Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
<br />    a written agreement with Participant.
<br />
<br />    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
<br />    alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
<br />    infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
<br />    license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
<br />    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
<br />    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
<br />    into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
<br />    license.
<br />
<br />    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
<br />    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
<br />    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
<br />    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
<br />
<br />7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
<br />
<br />    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
<br />    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
<br />    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
<br />    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
<br />    TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
<br />    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
<br />    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
<br />    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
<br />    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
<br />    APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
<br />    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
<br />    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
<br />    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
<br />    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<br />
<br />8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

<br />    The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
<br />    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
<br />    software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
<br />    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"
<br />    as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
<br />    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
<br />    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
<br />    with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
<br />    clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
<br />    clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
<br />    software under this License.
<br />
<br />9. MISCELLANEOUS.
<br />
<br />    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
<br />    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
<br />    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
<br />    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
<br />    the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
<br />    the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
<br />    provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
<br />    provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
<br />    to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
<br />    venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
<br />    with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
<br />    limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
<br />    The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
<br />    the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
<br />    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
<br />    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
<br />    agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
<br />    States export administration regulations (and the export control
<br />    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
<br />    or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
<br />
<br />10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
<br />
<br />    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
<br />    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
<br />    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
<br />    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
<br />    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
<br />    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

<br />  The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />USA
<br />
<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />Preamble
<br />
<br />The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.
<br />
<br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />"modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />    under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />    is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />scope of this License.
<br />
<br />3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />    of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />    customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />    accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />executable.
<br />
<br />If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />along with the object code.
<br />
<br />4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />full compliance.
<br />
<br />5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />    Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />    (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />    General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />    it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />    James Hacker.

<br />This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />#
<br />
<br />Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its
<br />affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special
<br />exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its
<br />Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only
<br />where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's
<br />header the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to
<br />the "Classpath" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file
<br />that accompanied this code."
<br />
<br />You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent
<br />programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided
<br />under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software
<br />Foundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs
<br />licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are
<br />licensed to you under their original licenses.
<br />
<br />Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding
<br />the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which
<br />permits you to use that code in combination with other independent
<br />modules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would
<br />not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with
<br />Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such
<br />code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then
<br />distributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the
<br />Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and
<br />distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or
<br />all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and
<br />since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items
<br />included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath
<br />Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to
<br />further distribute the package.
<br />
<br />Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a
<br />lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath
<br />Exception or making modifications to this package which may
<br />subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party
<br />software.
<br />
<br />CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />combination.
<br />
<br />As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />from your version.&lt;/td&gt;

<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br />
<br />## Eclipse Public License - Version 2.0
<br />
<br />    Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br /> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br /> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
<br /> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
<br /> the version number 2.1.]
<br />
<br />                            Preamble
<br />
<br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br />
<br />  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br />specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br />Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br />can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br />this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br />strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<br />
<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br />not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br />you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br />for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br />it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br />it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br />these things.
<br />
<br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br />rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br />you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br />you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br />code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br />complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br />with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br />it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br />library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br />
<br />  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br />there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br />modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br />that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br />author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br />introduced by others.
<br />
<br />  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br />any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br />effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br />restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br />any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br />consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br />
<br />  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br />General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br />is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br />this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br />libraries into non-free programs.
<br />
<br />  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br />a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br />combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br />General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br />entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br />Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br />the library.
<br />
<br />  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br />does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br />Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br />of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br />are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br />libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br />special circumstances.
<br />
<br />  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br />encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
<br />a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
<br />allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br />library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br />case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br />software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br />  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br />programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br />free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br />non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br />operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br />system.
<br />
<br />  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br />users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br />linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br />that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br />
<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br />"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br />former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br />be combined with the library in order to run.
<br />
<br />                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br />program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br />other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br />Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br />
<br />  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br />which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br />Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br />straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br />included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br />
<br />  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
<br />and installation of the library.
<br />
<br />  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br />writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br />
<br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br />complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br />you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br />appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br />all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br />warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br />Library.
<br />
<br />  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br />fee.
<br />
<br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br />    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br />    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br />    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br />    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br />    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br />    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br />    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br />
<br />    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br />    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br />    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br />    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br />    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br />    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br />it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Library.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br />License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br />this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br />that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br />instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br />that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br />these notices.
<br />
<br />  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br />
<br />  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br />
<br />  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br />derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br />under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br />it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br />must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br />medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br />  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br />Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br />linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br />work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br />therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br />library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br />
<br />  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br />
<br />  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br />work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br />
<br />  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br />
<br />  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br />link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br />work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br />under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br />modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br />engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br />
<br />  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br />this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br />directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br />of these things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br />    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br />    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br />    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br />    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br />    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br />    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br />    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br />    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br />    to use the modified definitions.)
<br />
<br />    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br />    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br />    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br />    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br />    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br />    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
<br />    least three years, to give the same user the materials
<br />    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
<br />    than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br />
<br />    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br />    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br />    specified materials from the same place.
<br />
<br />    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br />    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br />
<br />  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br />Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br />reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br />the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br />the executable.
<br />
<br />  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br />accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br />distribute.
<br />
<br />  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br />facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br />library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br />the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br />permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br />    Sections above.
<br />
<br />    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br />    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br />    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br />  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br />the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br />attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br />distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br />rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br />or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br />terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Library or works based on it.
<br />
<br />  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br />subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br />this License.
<br />
<br />  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />impose that choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
<br />an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
<br />so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
<br />excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
<br />written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br />Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br />but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br />"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br />write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br />copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br />Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br />decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br />of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br />and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />                            NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br />KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br />LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br />THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br />FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br />CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br />LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br />RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
<br />SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br />DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br />
<br />  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
<br />everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
<br />redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
<br />ordinary General Public License).
<br />
<br />  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
<br />safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
<br />    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
<br />    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
<br />    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
<br />    Lesser General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
<br />necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
<br />
<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
<br />document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />Preamble
<br />
<br />The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
<br />and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
<br />guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
<br />software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
<br />most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
<br />authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
<br />covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
<br />your programs, too.
<br />
<br />When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
<br />General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
<br />distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
<br />that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
<br />the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
<br />can do these things.
<br />
<br />To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
<br />you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
<br />translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
<br />software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
<br />a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
<br />make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
<br />show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
<br />offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
<br />and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
<br />everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
<br />software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
<br />know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
<br />by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
<br />wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
<br />To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
<br />everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
<br />follow.
<br />
<br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
<br />placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
<br />or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
<br />derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
<br />Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
<br />translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
<br />without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
<br />"you".
<br />
<br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
<br />this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
<br />not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
<br />constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
<br />running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
<br />you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br />appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
<br />disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
<br />and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
<br />Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
<br />at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
<br />forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
<br />or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
<br />these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
<br />    that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
<br />    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
<br />    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
<br />    this License.
<br />
<br />    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
<br />    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
<br />    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
<br />    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
<br />    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
<br />    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
<br />    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
<br />    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
<br />    not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
<br />sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
<br />considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
<br />its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
<br />works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
<br />work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
<br />of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
<br />rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
<br />right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
<br />the Program.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
<br />Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
<br />distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
<br />License.
<br />
<br />3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
<br />Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
<br />2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
<br />    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
<br />    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
<br />    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
<br />    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
<br />    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
<br />    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
<br />    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
<br />    Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
<br />modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
<br />the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
<br />definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
<br />of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
<br />distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
<br />source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
<br />of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
<br />itself accompanies the executable.
<br />
<br />If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
<br />code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
<br />third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
<br />expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
<br />sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
<br />your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
<br />rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
<br />long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
<br />However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
<br />or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
<br />accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
<br />any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
<br />do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
<br />the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
<br />copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
<br />You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
<br />rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
<br />third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
<br />are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
<br />contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
<br />conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
<br />simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
<br />obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
<br />For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
<br />of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
<br />you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
<br />the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
<br />other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
<br />section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
<br />distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
<br />people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
<br />distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
<br />distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
<br />choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
<br />consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
<br />countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
<br />copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
<br />geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
<br />distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
<br />such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
<br />of this License.
<br />
<br />9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
<br />General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
<br />spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
<br />or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
<br />version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
<br />that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
<br />choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
<br />whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
<br />permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
<br />write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
<br />Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
<br />all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
<br />software generally.
<br />
<br />NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
<br />THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
<br />STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
<br />PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
<br />INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
<br />FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
<br />PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
<br />YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
<br />ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
<br />PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br />GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
<br />INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
<br />BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
<br />OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
<br />use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
<br />which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
<br />them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
<br />of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
<br />pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
<br />    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
<br />    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
<br />    any later version.
<br />
<br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
<br />    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
<br />    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
<br />    more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
<br />    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
<br />    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
<br />starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
<br />    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
<br />    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
<br />    type 'show c' for details.
<br />
<br />The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
<br />parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
<br />called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
<br />mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
<br />if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
<br />is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
<br />    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
<br />
<br />    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />
<br />    Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
<br />proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
<br />consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
<br />library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
<br />License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />
<br />"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
<br />
<br />Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are
<br />subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
<br />only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header
<br />the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
<br />exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
<br />    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
<br />    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
<br />    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
<br />    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
<br />    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
<br />    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
<br />    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
<br />    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
<br />    so, delete this exception statement from your version.

<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br /> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
<br /> the version number 2.1.]
<br />
<br />			    Preamble
<br />
<br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br />
<br />  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br />specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br />Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br />can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br />this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br />strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<br />
<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br />not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br />you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br />for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br />it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br />it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br />these things.
<br />
<br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br />rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br />you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br />you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br />code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br />complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br />with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br />it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br />library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br />
<br />  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br />there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br />modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br />that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br />author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br />introduced by others.
<br />
<br />  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br />any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br />effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br />restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br />any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br />consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br />
<br />  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br />General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br />is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br />this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br />libraries into non-free programs.
<br />
<br />  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br />a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br />combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br />General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br />entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br />Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br />the library.
<br />
<br />  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br />does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br />Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br />of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br />are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br />libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br />special circumstances.
<br />
<br />  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br />encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
<br />a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
<br />allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br />library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br />case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br />software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br />  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br />programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br />free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br />non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br />operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br />system.
<br />
<br />  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br />users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br />linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br />that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br />
<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br />"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br />former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br />be combined with the library in order to run.
<br /> 
<br />		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br />program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br />other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br />Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br />
<br />  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br />which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br />Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br />straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br />included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br />
<br />  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
<br />and installation of the library.
<br />
<br />  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br />writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br />  
<br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br />complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br />you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br />appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br />all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br />warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br />Library.
<br />
<br />  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br />fee.
<br /> 
<br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br />    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br />    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br />    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br />    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br />    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br />    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br />    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br />
<br />    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br />    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br />    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br />    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br />    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br />    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br />it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Library.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br />License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br />this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br />that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br />instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br />that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br />these notices.
<br /> 
<br />  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br />
<br />  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br />
<br />  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br />derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br />under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br />it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br />must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br />medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br />  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br />Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br />linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br />work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br />therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br />library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br />
<br />  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br />
<br />  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br />work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br />
<br />  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br /> 
<br />  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br />link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br />work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br />under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br />modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br />engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br />
<br />  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br />this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br />directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br />of these things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br />    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br />    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br />    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br />    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br />    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br />    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br />    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br />    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br />    to use the modified definitions.)
<br />
<br />    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br />    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br />    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br />    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br />    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br />    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
<br />    least three years, to give the same user the materials
<br />    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
<br />    than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br />
<br />    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br />    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br />    specified materials from the same place.
<br />
<br />    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br />    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br />
<br />  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br />Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br />reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br />the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br />the executable.
<br />
<br />  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br />accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br />distribute.
<br /> 
<br />  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br />facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br />library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br />the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br />permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br />    Sections above.
<br />
<br />    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br />    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br />    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br />  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br />the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br />attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br />distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br />rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br />or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br />terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Library or works based on it.
<br />
<br />  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br />subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br />this License.
<br /> 
<br />  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />impose that choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
<br />an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
<br />so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
<br />excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
<br />written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br />Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br />but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br />"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.
<br /> 
<br />  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br />write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br />copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br />Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br />decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br />of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br />and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />			    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br />KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br />LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br />THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br />FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br />CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br />LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br />RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
<br />SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br />DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />2. License Grants and Conditions
<br />--------------------------------
<br />
<br />2.1. Grants
<br />
<br />Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
<br />non-exclusive license:
<br />
<br />(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
<br />    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
<br />    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
<br />    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
<br />    as part of a Larger Work; and
<br />
<br />(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
<br />    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
<br />    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
<br />
<br />2.2. Effective Date
<br />
<br />The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
<br />become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
<br />distributes such Contribution.
<br />
<br />2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
<br />
<br />The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
<br />this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
<br />distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
<br />Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
<br />Contributor:
<br />
<br />(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
<br />    or
<br />
<br />(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
<br />    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
<br />    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
<br />    Version); or
<br />
<br />(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
<br />    its Contributions.
<br />
<br />This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
<br />or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
<br />the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
<br />
<br />2.4. Subsequent Licenses
<br />
<br />No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
<br />distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
<br />License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
<br />permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
<br />
<br />2.5. Representation
<br />
<br />Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
<br />Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
<br />to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
<br />
<br />2.6. Fair Use
<br />
<br />This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
<br />applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
<br />equivalents.
<br />
<br />2.7. Conditions
<br />
<br />Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
<br />in Section 2.1.
<br />
<br />3. Responsibilities
<br />-------------------
<br />
<br />3.1. Distribution of Source Form
<br />
<br />All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
<br />Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
<br />the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
<br />Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
<br />License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
<br />attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
<br />Form.
<br />
<br />3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
<br />
<br />If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
<br />
<br />(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
<br />    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
<br />    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
<br />    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
<br />    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
<br />
<br />(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
<br />    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
<br />    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
<br />    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
<br />
<br />3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
<br />
<br />You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
<br />provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
<br />the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
<br />Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
<br />Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
<br />License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
<br />under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
<br />the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
<br />Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
<br />License(s).
<br />
<br />3.4. Notices
<br />
<br />You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
<br />(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
<br />or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
<br />the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
<br />the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
<br />
<br />3.5. Application of Additional Terms
<br />
<br />You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
<br />indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
<br />Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
<br />behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
<br />such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
<br />You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
<br />liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
<br />indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
<br />disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
<br />jurisdiction.
<br />
<br />4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
<br />---------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
<br />License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
<br />statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
<br />the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
<br />describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
<br />be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
<br />Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
<br />or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
<br />recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
<br />
<br />5. Termination
<br />--------------
<br />
<br />5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
<br />if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
<br />compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
<br />Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
<br />Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
<br />ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
<br />non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
<br />come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
<br />Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
<br />notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
<br />first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
<br />from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
<br />Your receipt of the notice.
<br />
<br />5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
<br />infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
<br />counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
<br />directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
<br />You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
<br />2.1 of this License shall terminate.
<br />
<br />5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
<br />end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
<br />have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
<br />prior to termination shall survive termination.

<br />*                                                                      *
<br />*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
<br />*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
<br />*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
<br />*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
<br />*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
<br />*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
<br />*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
<br />*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
<br />*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
<br />*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
<br />*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
<br />*                                                                      *

<br />************************************************************************
<br />*                                                                      *
<br />*  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *
<br />*  --------------------------                                          *
<br />*                                                                      *
<br />*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
<br />*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
<br />*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
<br />*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
<br />*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
<br />*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
<br />*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *
<br />*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *
<br />*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *
<br />*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *
<br />*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
<br />*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
<br />*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
<br />*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
<br />*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
<br />*                                                                      *
<br />************************************************************************
<br />
<br />8. Litigation
<br />-------------
<br />
<br />Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
<br />courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
<br />place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
<br />jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
<br />Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
<br />cross-claims or counter-claims.
<br />
<br />9. Miscellaneous
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
<br />matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
<br />unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
<br />necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
<br />that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
<br />shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
<br />
<br />10. Versions of the License
<br />---------------------------
<br />
<br />10.1. New Versions
<br />
<br />Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
<br />10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
<br />publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
<br />distinguishing version number.
<br />
<br />10.2. Effect of New Versions
<br />
<br />You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
<br />of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
<br />or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
<br />steward.
<br />
<br />10.3. Modified Versions
<br />
<br />If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
<br />create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
<br />modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
<br />any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
<br />such modified license differs from this License).
<br />
<br />10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
<br />Licenses
<br />
<br />If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
<br />Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
<br />notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
<br />
<br />Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

<br />
<br />If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
<br />for such a notice.
<br />
<br />You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
<br />

<br />The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the
<br />"Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the best of
<br />his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public domain of

<br />described as a "dedicator" below.
<br />
<br />A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of this

<br />
<br />Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to
<br />the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends this
<br />dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present
<br />and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the
<br />Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes
<br />the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those
<br />copyrights in the Work.
<br />
<br />Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be
<br />freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or
<br />otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
<br />and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />The Checker Framework
<br />Copyright 2004-present by the Checker Framework developers
<br />
<br />
<br />Most of the Checker Framework is licensed under the GNU General Public
<br />License, version 2 (GPL2), with the classpath exception.  The text of this
<br />license appears below.  This is the same license used for OpenJDK.
<br />
<br />A few parts of the Checker Framework have more permissive licenses, notably
<br />the parts that you might want to include with your own program.
<br />
<br /> * The annotations and utility files are licensed under the MIT License.
<br />   (The text of this license also appears below.)  This applies to
<br />   checker-qual*.jar and checker-util.jar and all the files that appear in
<br />   them, which is all files in checker-qual and checker-util directories.
<br />   It also applies to the cleanroom implementations of
<br />   third-party annotations (in checker/src/testannotations/,
<br />   framework/src/main/java/org/jmlspecs/, and
<br />   framework/src/main/java/com/google/).
<br />
<br />The Checker Framework includes annotations for some libraries.  Those in
<br />.astub files use the MIT License.  Those in https://github.com/typetools/jdk
<br />(which appears in the annotated-jdk directory of file checker.jar) use the
<br />GPL2 license.
<br />
<br />Some external libraries that are included with the Checker Framework
<br />distribution have different licenses.  Here are some examples.
<br />
<br /> * JavaParser is dual licensed under the LGPL or the Apache license -- you
<br />   may use it under whichever one you want.  (The JavaParser source code
<br />   contains a file with the text of the GPL, but it is not clear why, since
<br />   JavaParser does not use the GPL.)  See
<br />   https://github.com/typetools/stubparser .
<br />
<br /> * Annotation Tools (https://github.com/typetools/annotation-tools) uses
<br />   the MIT license.
<br />
<br /> * Libraries in plume-lib (https://github.com/plume-lib/) are licensed

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following

<br />Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
<br />
<br />THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
<br />LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
<br />CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />"Contribution" means:
<br />     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
<br />     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
<br />          i) changes to the Program, and
<br />          ii) additions to the Program;
<br />
<br />where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
<br />distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
<br />Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or
<br />anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
<br />additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
<br />distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
<br />and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
<br />"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
<br />necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
<br />combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
<br />Agreement.
<br />
<br />"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
<br />including all Contributors.
<br />
<br />2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
<br />     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
<br />     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
<br />     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
<br />
<br />     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
<br />     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
<br />     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
<br />     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
<br />     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
<br />     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is
<br />     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
<br />     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
<br />     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
<br />     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent
<br />     or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
<br />     Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
<br />     any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
<br />     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
<br />     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
<br />     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
<br />     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute
<br />     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />     before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
<br />     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
<br />     license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
<br />its own license agreement, provided that:
<br />
<br />     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
<br />
<br />     b) its license agreement:
<br />          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
<br />          warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
<br />          or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
<br />          or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
<br />          purpose;
<br />          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
<br />          for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
<br />          consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
<br />          offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
<br />          iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
<br />          Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
<br />          manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
<br />          exchange.
<br />
<br />When the Program is made available in source code form:
<br />
<br />     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
<br />
<br />     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
<br />     Program.
<br />Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
<br />the Program.
<br />
<br />Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
<br />if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
<br />the originator of the Contribution.
<br />
<br />4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
<br />respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
<br />intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
<br />includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
<br />which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
<br />if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
<br />Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
<br />every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and
<br />other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
<br />Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
<br />product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
<br />or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
<br />infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
<br />promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
<br />allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
<br />Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
<br />Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
<br />offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
<br />that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
<br />warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
<br />such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
<br />Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
<br />Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
<br />court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
<br />Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
<br />
<br />5. NO WARRANTY
<br />EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
<br />"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
<br />NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
<br />Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
<br />and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
<br />exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the
<br />risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to
<br />or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
<br />operations.
<br />
<br />6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
<br />CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
<br />SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
<br />LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
<br />OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
<br />remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
<br />parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
<br />necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
<br />(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
<br />infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
<br />under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
<br />comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
<br />not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
<br />such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
<br />Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
<br />reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
<br />and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
<br />and survive.
<br />
<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
<br />order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
<br />modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
<br />publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
<br />time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
<br />Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
<br />Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
<br />Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
<br />be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
<br />Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
<br />Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
<br />Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
<br />(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
<br />stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
<br />licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
<br />whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
<br />Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
<br />
<br />This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
<br />intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
<br />Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
<br />after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
<br />in any resulting litigation.

<br />
<br /> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br /> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
<br /> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
<br /> the version number 2.1.]
<br />
<br />                            Preamble
<br />
<br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br />
<br />  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br />specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br />Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br />can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br />this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br />strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<br />
<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br />not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br />you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br />for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br />it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br />it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br />these things.
<br />
<br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br />rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br />you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br />you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br />code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br />complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br />with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br />it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br />library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br />
<br />  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br />there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br />modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br />that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br />author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br />introduced by others.
<br />
<br />  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br />any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br />effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br />restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br />any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br />consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br />
<br />  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br />General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br />is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br />this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br />libraries into non-free programs.
<br />
<br />  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br />a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br />combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br />General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br />entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br />Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br />the library.
<br />
<br />  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br />does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br />Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br />of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br />are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br />libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br />special circumstances.
<br />
<br />  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br />encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
<br />a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
<br />allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br />library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br />case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br />software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br />  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br />programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br />free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br />non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br />operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br />system.
<br />
<br />  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br />users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br />linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br />that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br />
<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br />"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br />former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br />be combined with the library in order to run.
<br />
<br />                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br />program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br />other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br />Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br />
<br />  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br />which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br />Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br />straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br />included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br />
<br />  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
<br />and installation of the library.
<br />
<br />  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br />writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br />
<br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br />complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br />you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br />appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br />all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br />warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br />Library.
<br />
<br />  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br />fee.
<br />
<br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br />    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br />    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br />    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br />    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br />    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br />    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br />    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br />
<br />    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br />    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br />    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br />    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br />    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br />    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br />it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Library.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br />License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br />this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br />that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br />instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br />that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br />these notices.
<br />
<br />  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br />
<br />  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br />
<br />  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br />derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br />under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br />it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br />must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br />medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br />  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br />Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br />linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br />work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br />therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br />library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br />
<br />  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br />
<br />  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br />work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br />
<br />  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br />
<br />  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br />link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br />work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br />under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br />modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br />engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br />
<br />  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br />this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br />directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br />of these things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br />    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br />    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br />    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br />    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br />    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br />    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br />    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br />    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br />    to use the modified definitions.)
<br />
<br />    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br />    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br />    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br />    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br />    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br />    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
<br />    least three years, to give the same user the materials
<br />    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
<br />    than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br />
<br />    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br />    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br />    specified materials from the same place.
<br />
<br />    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br />    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br />
<br />  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br />Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br />reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br />the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br />the executable.
<br />
<br />  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br />accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br />distribute.
<br />
<br />  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br />facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br />library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br />the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br />permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br />    Sections above.
<br />
<br />    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br />    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br />    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br />  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br />the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br />attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br />distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br />rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br />or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br />terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Library or works based on it.
<br />
<br />  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br />subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br />this License.
<br />
<br />  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />impose that choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
<br />an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
<br />so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
<br />excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
<br />written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br />Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br />but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br />"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br />write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br />copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br />Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br />decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br />of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br />and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />                            NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br />KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br />LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br />THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br />FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br />CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br />LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br />RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
<br />SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br />DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br />
<br />  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
<br />everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
<br />redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
<br />ordinary General Public License).
<br />
<br />  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
<br />safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
<br />    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
<br />    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
<br />    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
<br />    Lesser General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
<br />necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

<br />
<br />Definitions
<br />
<br />"Oracle" refers to Oracle America, Inc. "You" and "Your" refers to 
<br />(a) a company or organization (each an "Entity") accessing the Programs, if use 
<br />of the Programs will be on behalf of such Entity; or 
<br />(b) an individual accessing the Programs, if use of the Programs will not be on 
<br />behalf of an Entity. "Program(s)" refers to Oracle software provided by Oracle 
<br />pursuant to the following terms and any updates, error corrections, and/or 
<br />Program Documentation provided by Oracle. "Program Documentation" refers to 
<br />Program user manuals and Program installation manuals, if any. If available, 
<br />Program Documentation may be delivered with the Programs and/or may be accessed 
<br />from www.oracle.com/documentation. "Separate Terms" refers to separate license 
<br />terms that are specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice files 
<br />and that apply to Separately Licensed Technology. "Separately Licensed Technology" 
<br />refers to Oracle or third party technology that is licensed under Separate Terms 
<br />and not under the terms of this license.
<br />
<br />Separately Licensed Technology
<br />
<br />Oracle may provide certain notices to You in Program Documentation, readmes or 
<br />notice files in connection with Oracle or third party technology provided as or 
<br />with the Programs. If specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice 
<br />files, such technology will be licensed to You under Separate Terms. Your rights 
<br />to use Separately Licensed Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted in 
<br />any way by the terms herein. For clarity, notwithstanding the existence of a 
<br />notice, third party technology that is not Separately Licensed Technology shall 
<br />be deemed part of the Programs licensed to You under the terms of this license.
<br />
<br />Source Code for Open Source Software
<br />
<br />For software that You receive from Oracle in binary form that is licensed under 
<br />an open source license that gives You the right to receive the source code for 
<br />that binary, You can obtain a copy of the applicable source code from 
<br />https://oss.oracle.com/sources/ or http://www.oracle.com/goto/opensourcecode. 
<br />If the source code for such software was not provided to You with the binary, 
<br />You can also receive a copy of the source code on physical media by submitting 
<br />a written request pursuant to the instructions in the "Written Offer for Source 
<br />Code" section of the latter website.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The following license terms apply to those Programs that are not provided to You 
<br />under Separate Terms.
<br />
<br />License Rights and Restrictions
<br />
<br />Oracle grants to You, as a recipient of this Program, a nonexclusive, 
<br />nontransferable, limited license to, subject to the conditions stated herein, 
<br />(a) internally use the unmodified Programs for the purposes of developing, 
<br />testing, prototyping and demonstrating your applications, and running the 
<br />Programs for your own internal business operations; and 
<br />(b) redistribute unmodified Programs and Programs Documentation, under the terms 
<br />of this License, provided that You do not charge Your end users any additional 
<br />fees for the use of the Programs. You may make copies of the Programs to the 
<br />extent reasonably necessary for exercising the license rights granted herein 
<br />and for backup purposes. You are granted the right to use the Programs to 
<br />provide third party training in the use of the Programs and associated Separately 
<br />Licensed Technology only if there is express authorization of such use by Oracle 
<br />on the Program's download page or in the Program Documentation.
<br />
<br />Your license is contingent on Your compliance with the following conditions:
<br />
<br />- You include a copy of this license with any distribution by You of the Programs;
<br />
<br />- You do not remove markings or notices of either Oracle's or a licensor's 
<br />proprietary rights from the Programs or Program Documentation;
<br />
<br />- You comply with all U.S. and applicable export control and economic sanctions 
<br />laws and regulations that govern Your use of the Programs (including technical data);
<br />
<br />- You do not cause or permit reverse engineering, disassembly or decompilation 
<br />of the Programs (except as allowed by law) by You nor allow an associated party to do so.
<br />
<br />For clarity, any source code that may be included in the distribution with the 
<br />Programs is provided solely for reference purposes and may not be modified, 
<br />unless such source code is under Separate Terms permitting modification.
<br />
<br />Ownership
<br />
<br />Oracle or its licensors retain all ownership and intellectual property rights to the Programs.
<br />
<br />Information Collection
<br />
<br />The Programs' installation and/or auto-update processes, if any, may transmit a 
<br />limited amount of data to Oracle or its service provider about those processes 
<br />to help Oracle understand and optimize them. Oracle does not associate the data 
<br />with personally identifiable information. 
<br />Refer to Oracle's Privacy Policy at www.oracle.com/privacy.
<br />
<br />Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability
<br />
<br />THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ORACLE FURTHER 
<br />DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.
<br />
<br />IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL ORACLE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR 
<br />DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
<br />ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
<br />TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
<br />THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), 
<br />EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<br />Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to

<br />dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present
<br />and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the
<br />Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes
<br />the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those
<br />copyrights in the Work.
<br />
<br />Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be
<br />freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or
<br />otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
<br />and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />

<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
<br />document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />Preamble
<br />
<br />The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
<br />and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
<br />guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
<br />software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
<br />most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
<br />authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
<br />covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
<br />your programs, too.
<br />
<br />When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
<br />General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
<br />distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
<br />that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
<br />the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
<br />can do these things.
<br />
<br />To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
<br />you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
<br />translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
<br />software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
<br />a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
<br />make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
<br />show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
<br />offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
<br />and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
<br />everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
<br />software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
<br />know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
<br />by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
<br />wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
<br />To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
<br />everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
<br />follow.
<br />
<br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
<br />placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
<br />or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
<br />derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
<br />Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
<br />translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
<br />without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
<br />"you".
<br />
<br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
<br />this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
<br />not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
<br />constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
<br />running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
<br />you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br />appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
<br />disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
<br />and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
<br />Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
<br />at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
<br />forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
<br />or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
<br />these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
<br />    that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
<br />    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
<br />    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
<br />    this License.
<br />
<br />    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
<br />    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
<br />    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
<br />    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
<br />    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
<br />    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
<br />    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
<br />    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
<br />    not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
<br />sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
<br />considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
<br />its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
<br />works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
<br />work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
<br />of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
<br />rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
<br />right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
<br />the Program.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
<br />Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
<br />distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
<br />License.
<br />
<br />3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
<br />Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
<br />2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
<br />    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
<br />    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
<br />    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
<br />    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
<br />    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
<br />    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
<br />    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
<br />    Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
<br />modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
<br />the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
<br />definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
<br />of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
<br />distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
<br />source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
<br />of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
<br />itself accompanies the executable.
<br />
<br />If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
<br />code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
<br />third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
<br />expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
<br />sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
<br />your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
<br />rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
<br />long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
<br />However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
<br />or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
<br />accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
<br />any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
<br />do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
<br />the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
<br />copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
<br />You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
<br />rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
<br />third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
<br />are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
<br />contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
<br />conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
<br />simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
<br />obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
<br />For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
<br />of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
<br />you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
<br />the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
<br />other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
<br />section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
<br />distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
<br />people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
<br />distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
<br />distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
<br />choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
<br />consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
<br />countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
<br />copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
<br />geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
<br />distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
<br />such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
<br />of this License.
<br />
<br />9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
<br />General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
<br />spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
<br />or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
<br />version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
<br />that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
<br />choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
<br />whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
<br />permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
<br />write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
<br />Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
<br />all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
<br />software generally.
<br />
<br />NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
<br />THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
<br />STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
<br />PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
<br />INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
<br />FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
<br />PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
<br />YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
<br />ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
<br />PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br />GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
<br />INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
<br />BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
<br />OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
<br />use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
<br />which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
<br />them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
<br />of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
<br />pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
<br />    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
<br />    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
<br />    any later version.
<br />
<br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
<br />    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
<br />    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
<br />    more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
<br />    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
<br />    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
<br />starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
<br />    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
<br />    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
<br />    type 'show c' for details.
<br />
<br />The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
<br />parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
<br />called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
<br />mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
<br />if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
<br />is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
<br />    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

<br />
<br />This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
<br />proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
<br />consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
<br />library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
<br />License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />
<br />"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
<br />
<br />Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are
<br />subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
<br />only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header
<br />the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
<br />exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
<br />    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
<br />    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
<br />    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
<br />    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
<br />    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
<br />    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
<br />    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
<br />    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
<br />    so, delete this exception statement from your version.

<br />     1.10. "Original Code" means Source Code of computer software code
<br />     which is described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A as
<br />     Original Code, and which, at the time of its release under this
<br />     License is not already Covered Code governed by this License.
<br />
<br />     1.10.1. "Patent Claims" means any patent claim(s), now owned or
<br />     hereafter acquired, including without limitation,  method, process,
<br />     and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by grantor.
<br />
<br />     1.11. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Covered Code for
<br />     making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus
<br />     any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control
<br />     compilation and installation of an Executable, or source code
<br />     differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another
<br />     well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The
<br />     Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the
<br />     appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available
<br />     for no charge.
<br />
<br />     1.12. "You" (or "Your")  means an individual or a legal entity
<br />     exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this
<br />     License or a future version of this License issued under Section 6.1.
<br />     For legal entities, "You" includes any entity which controls, is
<br />     controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes of
<br />     this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect,
<br />     to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
<br />     contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent
<br />     (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such
<br />     entity.
<br />
<br />2. Source Code License.
<br />
<br />     2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
<br />     The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
<br />     non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
<br />     claims:
<br />          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
<br />          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
<br />          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
<br />          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
<br />          as part of a Larger Work; and
<br />
<br />          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
<br />          selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
<br />          sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
<br />          Original Code (or portions thereof).
<br />
<br />          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
<br />          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
<br />          Original Code under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
<br />          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
<br />          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
<br />          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
<br />          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
<br />
<br />     2.2. Contributor Grant.
<br />     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
<br />     hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
<br />
<br />          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
<br />          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
<br />          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
<br />          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
<br />          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
<br />          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
<br />
<br />          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
<br />          selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
<br />          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
<br />          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
<br />          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
<br />          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
<br />          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
<br />          Version (or portions of such combination).
<br />
<br />          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
<br />          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
<br />          the Covered Code.
<br />
<br />          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
<br />          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
<br />          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
<br />          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
<br />          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
<br />          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
<br />          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
<br />          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
<br />          that Contributor.
<br />
<br />3. Distribution Obligations.
<br />
<br />     3.1. Application of License.
<br />     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
<br />     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
<br />     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
<br />     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
<br />     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
<br />     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
<br />     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
<br />     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
<br />     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
<br />     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
<br />     Section 3.5.
<br />
<br />     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
<br />     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
<br />     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
<br />     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
<br />     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
<br />     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
<br />     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
<br />     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
<br />     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
<br />     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
<br />     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
<br />     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
<br />
<br />     3.3. Description of Modifications.
<br />     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
<br />     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
<br />     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
<br />     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
<br />     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
<br />     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
<br />     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
<br />     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
<br />
<br />     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
<br />          (a) Third Party Claims.
<br />          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
<br />          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
<br />          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
<br />          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
<br />          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
<br />          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
<br />          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
<br />          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
<br />          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
<br />          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
<br />          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
<br />          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
<br />          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
<br />
<br />          (b) Contributor APIs.
<br />          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
<br />          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
<br />          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
<br />          also include this information in the LEGAL file.
<br />
<br />               (c)    Representations.
<br />          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
<br />          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
<br />          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
<br />          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
<br />          this License.
<br />
<br />     3.5. Required Notices.
<br />     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
<br />     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
<br />     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
<br />     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
<br />     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
<br />     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
<br />     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
<br />     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
<br />     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
<br />     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
<br />     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
<br />     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
<br />     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
<br />     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
<br />     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
<br />     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
<br />     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
<br />     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
<br />
<br />     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
<br />     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
<br />     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
<br />     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
<br />     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
<br />     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
<br />     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
<br />     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
<br />     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
<br />     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
<br />     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
<br />     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
<br />     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
<br />     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
<br />     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
<br />     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
<br />     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
<br />     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
<br />     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
<br />     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
<br />     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
<br />     terms You offer.
<br />
<br />     3.7. Larger Works.
<br />     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
<br />     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
<br />     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
<br />     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
<br />
<br />4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
<br />
<br />     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
<br />     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
<br />     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
<br />     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
<br />     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
<br />     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
<br />     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
<br />     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
<br />     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
<br />     understand it.
<br />
<br />5. Application of this License.
<br />
<br />     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
<br />     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
<br />
<br />6. Versions of the License.
<br />
<br />     6.1. New Versions.
<br />     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
<br />     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
<br />     will be given a distinguishing version number.
<br />
<br />     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
<br />     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
<br />     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
<br />     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
<br />     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
<br />     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
<br />     Covered Code created under this License.
<br />
<br />     6.3. Derivative Works.
<br />     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
<br />     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
<br />     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
<br />     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
<br />     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
<br />     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
<br />     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
<br />     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
<br />     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
<br />     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
<br />     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
<br />     this License.)
<br />
<br />7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
<br />
<br />     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
<br />     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
<br />     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
<br />     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
<br />     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
<br />     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
<br />     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
<br />     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
<br />     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
<br />
<br />8. TERMINATION.
<br />
<br />     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
<br />     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
<br />     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
<br />     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
<br />     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
<br />     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
<br />     shall survive.
<br />
<br />     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
<br />     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
<br />     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
<br />     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
<br />
<br />     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
<br />     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
<br />     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
<br />     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
<br />     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
<br />     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
<br />     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
<br />     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
<br />     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
<br />     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
<br />     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
<br />     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
<br />     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
<br />     the 60 day notice period specified above.
<br />
<br />     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
<br />     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
<br />     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
<br />     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
<br />     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
<br />     Participant.
<br />
<br />     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
<br />     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
<br />     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
<br />     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
<br />     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
<br />     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
<br />     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
<br />     license.
<br />
<br />     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
<br />     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
<br />     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
<br />     prior to termination shall survive termination.
<br />
<br />9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
<br />
<br />     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
<br />     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
<br />     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
<br />     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
<br />     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
<br />     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
<br />     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
<br />     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
<br />     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
<br />     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
<br />     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
<br />     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
<br />     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
<br />     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<br />
<br />10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
<br />
<br />     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
<br />     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
<br />     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
<br />     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
<br />     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
<br />     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
<br />     rights set forth herein.
<br />
<br />11. MISCELLANEOUS.
<br />
<br />     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
<br />     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
<br />     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
<br />     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
<br />     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
<br />     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
<br />     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
<br />     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
<br />     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
<br />     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
<br />     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
<br />     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
<br />     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
<br />     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
<br />     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
<br />     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
<br />     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
<br />     License.
<br />
<br />12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
<br />
<br />     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
<br />     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
<br />     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
<br />     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
<br />     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
<br />     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
<br />
<br />13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
<br />
<br />     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
<br />     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
<br />     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
<br />     Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
<br />     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

<br />
<br /> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br /> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
<br /> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
<br /> the version number 2.1.]
<br />
<br />                            Preamble
<br />
<br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br />
<br />  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br />specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br />Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br />can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br />this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br />strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<br />
<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br />not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br />you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br />for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br />it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br />it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br />these things.
<br />
<br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br />rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br />you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br />you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br />code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br />complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br />with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br />it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br />library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br />
<br />  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br />there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br />modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br />that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br />author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br />introduced by others.
<br />
<br />  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br />any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br />effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br />restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br />any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br />consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br />
<br />  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br />General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br />is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br />this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br />libraries into non-free programs.
<br />
<br />  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br />a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br />combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br />General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br />entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br />Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br />the library.
<br />
<br />  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br />does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br />Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br />of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br />are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br />libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br />special circumstances.
<br />
<br />  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br />encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
<br />a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
<br />allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br />library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br />case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br />software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br />  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br />programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br />free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br />non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br />operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br />system.
<br />
<br />  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br />users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br />linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br />that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br />
<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br />"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br />former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br />be combined with the library in order to run.
<br />
<br />                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br />program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br />other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br />Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br />
<br />  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br />which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br />Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br />straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br />included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br />
<br />  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
<br />and installation of the library.
<br />
<br />  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br />writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br />
<br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br />complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br />you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br />appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br />all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br />warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br />Library.
<br />
<br />  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br />fee.
<br />
<br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br />    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br />    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br />    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br />    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br />    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br />    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br />    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br />
<br />    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br />    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br />    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br />    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br />    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br />    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br />it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Library.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br />License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br />this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br />that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br />instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br />ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br />that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br />these notices.
<br />
<br />  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br />
<br />  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br />
<br />  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br />derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br />under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br />it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br />must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br />medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br />  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br />Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br />linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br />work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br />therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br />
<br />  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br />library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br />
<br />  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br />
<br />  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br />work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br />
<br />  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br />
<br />  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br />link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br />work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br />under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br />modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br />engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br />
<br />  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br />this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br />directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br />of these things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br />    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br />    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br />    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br />    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br />    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br />    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br />    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br />    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br />    to use the modified definitions.)
<br />
<br />    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br />    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br />    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br />    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br />    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br />    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
<br />    least three years, to give the same user the materials
<br />    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
<br />    than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br />
<br />    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br />    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br />    specified materials from the same place.
<br />
<br />    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br />    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br />
<br />  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br />Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br />reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br />the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br />the executable.
<br />
<br />  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br />accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br />distribute.
<br />
<br />  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br />facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br />library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br />the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br />permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br />    Sections above.
<br />
<br />    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br />    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br />    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br />  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br />the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br />attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br />distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br />rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br />or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br />terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br />  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />the Library or works based on it.
<br />
<br />  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br />Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br />subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br />this License.
<br />
<br />  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />impose that choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
<br />an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
<br />so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
<br />excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
<br />written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br />Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br />but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br />"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br />write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br />copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br />Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br />decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br />of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br />and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />                            NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br />KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br />LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br />THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br />FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br />CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br />LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br />RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
<br />SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br />DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br />
<br />  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
<br />everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
<br />redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
<br />ordinary General Public License).
<br />
<br />  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
<br />safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
<br />    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of="" author="">

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.

<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or i</td>

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />

<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type

<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.

<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to

<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />EPL-2.0: LICENSE
<br />----------
<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />    2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
<br />
<br />    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject
<br />    to third party intellectual property claims, the Initial Developer
<br />    hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
<br />
<br />    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
<br />    trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use, reproduce,
<br />    modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
<br />    Software (or portions thereof), with or without Modifications,
<br />    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
<br />
<br />    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
<br />    Original Software, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and
<br />    offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software
<br />    (or portions thereof).
<br />
<br />    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on
<br />    the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes the
<br />    Original Software available to a third party under the terms of this
<br />    License.
<br />
<br />    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
<br />    granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software, or
<br />    (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the
<br />    Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software
<br />    with other software or devices.
<br />
<br />    2.2. Contributor Grant.
<br />
<br />    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject
<br />    to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby
<br />    grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
<br />
<br />    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
<br />    trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify,
<br />    display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
<br />    created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an
<br />    unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software
<br />    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
<br />
<br />    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
<br />    of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
<br />    combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
<br />    combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
<br />    otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or
<br />    portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by
<br />    that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
<br />    combination).
<br />
<br />    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective
<br />    on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the
<br />    Modifications available to a third party.
<br />
<br />    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
<br />    granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
<br />    Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third
<br />    party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination
<br />    of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software
<br />    (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)
<br />    under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
<br />    Modifications made by that Contributor.
<br />
<br />3. Distribution Obligations.
<br />
<br />    3.1. Availability of Source Code.
<br />
<br />    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
<br />    in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
<br />    and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
<br />    of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
<br />    copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
<br />    or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
<br />    Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
<br />    Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
<br />    through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
<br />
<br />    3.2. Modifications.
<br />
<br />    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
<br />    governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
<br />    believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
<br />    have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
<br />
<br />    3.3. Required Notices.
<br />
<br />    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
<br />    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
<br />    remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
<br />    within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
<br />    descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
<br />    Initial Developer.
<br />
<br />    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
<br />
<br />    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
<br />    Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
<br />    this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
<br />    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
<br />    liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
<br />    However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
<br />    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
<br />    absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
<br />    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
<br />    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
<br />    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
<br />    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
<br />
<br />    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
<br />
<br />    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
<br />    the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
<br />    choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
<br />    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
<br />    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
<br />    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
<br />    the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
<br />    Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
<br />    it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
<br />    are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
<br />    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
<br />    every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
<br />    Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
<br />
<br />    3.6. Larger Works.
<br />
<br />    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
<br />    other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
<br />    the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
<br />    sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
<br />    Software.
<br />
<br />4. Versions of the License.
<br />
<br />    4.1. New Versions.
<br />
<br />    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
<br />    new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
<br />    given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
<br />    4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
<br />    this License.
<br />
<br />    4.2. Effect of New Versions.
<br />
<br />    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
<br />    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
<br />    License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
<br />    the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
<br />    prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
<br />    under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
<br />    make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
<br />    of the License under which You originally received the Covered
<br />    Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
<br />    otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
<br />    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
<br />
<br />    4.3. Modified Versions.
<br />
<br />    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
<br />    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
<br />    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
<br />    remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
<br />    note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
<br />    make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
<br />    License.
<br />
<br />5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
<br />
<br />    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
<br />    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
<br />    IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
<br />    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
<br />    THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
<br />    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
<br />    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
<br />    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
<br />    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
<br />    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
<br />
<br />6. TERMINATION.
<br />
<br />    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
<br />    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
<br />    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
<br />    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
<br />    termination of this License shall survive.
<br />
<br />    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
<br />    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
<br />    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
<br />    assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
<br />    Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
<br />    Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
<br />    Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
<br />    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
<br />    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
<br />    Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
<br />    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
<br />    from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
<br />    expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
<br />    day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
<br />    Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
<br />    a written agreement with Participant.
<br />
<br />    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
<br />    alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
<br />    infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
<br />    license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
<br />    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
<br />    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
<br />    into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
<br />    license.
<br />
<br />    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
<br />    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
<br />    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
<br />    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
<br />
<br />7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
<br />
<br />    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
<br />    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
<br />    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
<br />    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
<br />    TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
<br />    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
<br />    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
<br />    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
<br />    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
<br />    APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
<br />    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
<br />    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
<br />    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
<br />    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<br />
<br />8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
<br />
<br />    The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
<br />    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
<br />    software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
<br />    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"
<br />    as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
<br />    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
<br />    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
<br />    with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
<br />    clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
<br />    clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
<br />    software under this License.
<br />
<br />9. MISCELLANEOUS.
<br />
<br />    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
<br />    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
<br />    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
<br />    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
<br />    the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
<br />    the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
<br />    provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
<br />    provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
<br />    to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
<br />    venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
<br />    with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
<br />    limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
<br />    The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
<br />    the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
<br />    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
<br />    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
<br />    agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
<br />    States export administration regulations (and the export control
<br />    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
<br />    or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
<br />
<br />10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
<br />
<br />    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
<br />    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
<br />    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
<br />    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
<br />    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
<br />    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

<br />
<br />Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />USA
<br />
<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />Preamble
<br />
<br />The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />modification follow.
<br />
<br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />"modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />    under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />    is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />scope of this License.
<br />
<br />3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />    of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />    customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />    accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />executable.
<br />
<br />If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />along with the object code.
<br />
<br />4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />full compliance.
<br />
<br />5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />circumstances.
<br />
<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />    Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />    (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />    General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />    it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />    James Hacker.

<br />
<br />This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />#
<br />
<br />Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its
<br />affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special
<br />exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its
<br />Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only
<br />where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's
<br />header the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to
<br />the "Classpath" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file
<br />that accompanied this code."
<br />
<br />You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent
<br />programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided
<br />under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software
<br />Foundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs
<br />licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are
<br />licensed to you under their original licenses.
<br />
<br />Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding
<br />the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which
<br />permits you to use that code in combination with other independent
<br />modules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would
<br />not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with
<br />Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such
<br />code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then
<br />distributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the
<br />Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and
<br />distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or
<br />all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and
<br />since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items
<br />included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath
<br />Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to
<br />further distribute the package.
<br />
<br />Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a
<br />lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath
<br />Exception or making modifications to this package which may
<br />subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party
<br />software.
<br />
<br />CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />combination.
<br />
<br />As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement&lt;/td&gt;

<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present

<br />Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes
<br />the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
<br />
<br />    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
<br />
<br />    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
<br />    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
<br />    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
<br />    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."
<br />
<br />      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
<br />      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
<br />
<br />      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
<br />      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
<br />      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
<br />      look for such a notice.
<br />
<br />      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

<br />##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
<br />
<br />    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.
<br />
<br />        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
<br />        Ty Coon, President of Vice
<br />
<br />    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.

<br />
<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br />      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br />      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br />      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br />      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br />      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br />      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br />      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br />   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br />   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br />      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />      identification within third-party archives.

<br />      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br />      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br />      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br />      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br />      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br />   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br />   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br />   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br />   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br />   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br />

<br />      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

<br />
<br />      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br />      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

<br />      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br />   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

<br />      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

<br />          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br />      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

<br />      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />

<br />      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

<br />      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

<br /># Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
<br />
<br />        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
<br />        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
<br />        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
<br />
<br />    1. DEFINITIONS
<br />
<br />    "Contribution" means:
<br />
<br />      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
<br />         Distributed under this Agreement, and
<br />
<br />      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
<br />         i) changes to the Program, and 
<br />         ii) additions to the Program;
<br />      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
<br />      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
<br />      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
<br />      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
<br />      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
<br />      are not Modified Works.
<br />
<br />    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
<br />    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
<br />    or when combined with the Program.
<br />
<br />    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
<br />    Agreement.
<br />
<br />    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
<br />    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
<br />
<br />    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
<br />    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
<br />    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
<br />
<br />    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
<br />    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
<br />    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
<br />    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
<br />    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
<br />    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
<br />    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
<br />    or Modified Works thereof.
<br />
<br />    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
<br />    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
<br />
<br />    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
<br />    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
<br />    documentation source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br />    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
<br />    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
<br />    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
<br />    Contributor.
<br />
<br />    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
<br />
<br />      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
<br />      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
<br />      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
<br />      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
<br />
<br />      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
<br />      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
<br />      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
<br />      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
<br />      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
<br />      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
<br />      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
<br />      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
<br />      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
<br />      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
<br />      licensed hereunder.
<br />
<br />      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
<br />      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
<br />      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
<br />      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
<br />      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
<br />      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
<br />      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
<br />      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
<br />      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
<br />      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
<br />      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
<br />      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
<br />      before distributing the Program.
<br />
<br />      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
<br />      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
<br />      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
<br />
<br />      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
<br />      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
<br />      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
<br />      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
<br />      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
<br />
<br />    3. REQUIREMENTS
<br />
<br />    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
<br />
<br />      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
<br />      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
<br />      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
<br />      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
<br />      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
<br />      used for software exchange; and
<br />
<br />      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
<br />      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
<br />         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
<br />         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
<br />         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
<br />         for a particular purpose;
<br />
<br />         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
<br />         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
<br />         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
<br />
<br />         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
<br />         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
<br />
<br />         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
<br />         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
<br />         of this section 3.
<br />
<br />    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
<br />
<br />      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
<br />      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
<br />      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
<br />      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
<br />      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
<br />      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
<br />
<br />      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
<br />      the Program.
<br />
<br />    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
<br />    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
<br />    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
<br />    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
<br />    their own appropriate notices.
<br />
<br />    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br />    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
<br />    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
<br />    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
<br />    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
<br />    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
<br />    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
<br />    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
<br />    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
<br />    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
<br />    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
<br />    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
<br />    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
<br />    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
<br />    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
<br />    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
<br />    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
<br />    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
<br />    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
<br />    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
<br />    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
<br />    participate in any such claim at its own expense.
<br />
<br />    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
<br />    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
<br />    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
<br />    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
<br />    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
<br />    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
<br />    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
<br />    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
<br />    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
<br />    those damages.
<br />
<br />    5. NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
<br />    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
<br />    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
<br />    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
<br />    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
<br />    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
<br />    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
<br />    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
<br />    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
<br />
<br />    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
<br />
<br />    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
<br />    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
<br />    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
<br />    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
<br />    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
<br />    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
<br />    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
<br />    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
<br />    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    7. GENERAL
<br />
<br />    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
<br />    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
<br />    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
<br />    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br />
<br />    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
<br />    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
<br />    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
<br />    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
<br />    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
<br />    litigation is filed.
<br />
<br />    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
<br />    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
<br />    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
<br />    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
<br />    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
<br />    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
<br />    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
<br />    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
<br />    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
<br />    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
<br />    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
<br />    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
<br />    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
<br />    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
<br />    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
<br />    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
<br />    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
<br />    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
<br />    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
<br />    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
<br />    Contributions) under the new version.
<br />
<br />    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
<br />    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
<br />    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
<br />    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
<br />    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
<br />    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
<br />    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

<br />    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
<br />    Boston, MA 02110-1335
<br />    USA
<br />
<br />    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br />    Preamble
<br />
<br />    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
<br />    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
<br />    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
<br />    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
<br />    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
<br />    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
<br />    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
<br />    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br />    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
<br />    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br />    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
<br />    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br />    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
<br />    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br />    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
<br />    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
<br />    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
<br />    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
<br />    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
<br />    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br />    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<br />    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<br />    distribute and/or modify the software.
<br />
<br />    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
<br />    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<br />    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
<br />    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
<br />    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
<br />    authors' reputations.
<br />
<br />    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
<br />    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
<br />    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
<br />    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<br />
<br />    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />    modification follow.
<br />
<br />    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br />    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
<br />    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
<br />    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
<br />    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
<br />    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
<br />    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
<br />    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
<br />    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
<br />    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br />    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
<br />    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
<br />    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
<br />    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
<br />    is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
<br />    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
<br />    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
<br />    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
<br />    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
<br />    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
<br />    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br />    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
<br />    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
<br />    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
<br />    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
<br />    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
<br />    that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br />        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br />        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
<br />        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
<br />        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
<br />        under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br />        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
<br />        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br />        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
<br />        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
<br />        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
<br />        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
<br />        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
<br />        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
<br />        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
<br />        is not required to print an announcement.)
<br />
<br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
<br />    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
<br />    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
<br />    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
<br />    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
<br />    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
<br />    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<br />
<br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />    collective works based on the Program.
<br />
<br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
<br />    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
<br />    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
<br />    scope of this License.
<br />
<br />    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
<br />    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
<br />        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
<br />        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
<br />        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
<br />        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
<br />        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
<br />        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
<br />        customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
<br />        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
<br />        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
<br />        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
<br />        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
<br />        accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
<br />    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
<br />    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
<br />    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
<br />    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
<br />    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
<br />    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
<br />    executable.
<br />
<br />    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
<br />    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
<br />    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
<br />    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
<br />    along with the object code.
<br />
<br />    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
<br />    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br />    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
<br />    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
<br />    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
<br />    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
<br />    full compliance.
<br />
<br />    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
<br />    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
<br />    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
<br />    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
<br />    Program or works based on it.
<br />
<br />    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
<br />    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
<br />    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
<br />    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
<br />    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<br />
<br />    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
<br />    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
<br />    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
<br />    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
<br />    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
<br />    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
<br />    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
<br />    distribution of the Program.
<br />
<br />    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
<br />    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
<br />    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
<br />    circumstances.
<br />
<br />    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
<br />    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
<br />    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
<br />    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
<br />    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
<br />    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
<br />    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
<br />    a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br />    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
<br />    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
<br />    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
<br />    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
<br />    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
<br />    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br />    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br />    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
<br />    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
<br />    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
<br />    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br />    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
<br />    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
<br />    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
<br />    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br />    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
<br />    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
<br />    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br />    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br />    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
<br />    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
<br />    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
<br />    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
<br />    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
<br />    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br />    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
<br />    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br />    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
<br />    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
<br />    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
<br />    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
<br />    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br />    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br />    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br />    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br />    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
<br />    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
<br />    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br />        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
<br />        Copyright (C) <year> <name of="" author="">
<br />
<br />        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br />        (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br />        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
<br />        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
<br />        General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br />        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
<br />
<br />    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br />    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
<br />    when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br />        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
<br />        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
<br />        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
<br />        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br />    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
<br />    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
<br />    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
<br />    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
<br />
<br />    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
<br />    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br />        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
<br />        James Hacker.

<br />    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
<br />    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
<br />    General Public License instead of this License.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
<br />    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
<br />    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
<br />    combination.
<br />
<br />    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
<br />    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
<br />    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
<br />    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
<br />    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
<br />    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
<br />    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
<br />    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
<br />    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
<br />    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
<br />    from your version.
