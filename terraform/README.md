These Terraform scripts are used in the following OCI guides:
  * MySQL
  * Serverless

>Note: DO NOT USE built-in macOS **Compress** menu option.

Instead, use command-line `zip`, as follows:

```bash
zip -r gcdk-mysql.zip gcdk-mysql
```

```bash
zip -r gcdk-function.zip gcdk-function
```

Then move the ZIP files to the _archive_ directory corresponding to the guide.
